# Deep-Analytics

Demo:

Pitch Deck

Notes for Demo: 
  * Only Nintendo Switch data is fully processed.
  * Wait until the page is fully loaded.

Here are some limits because since I am using a free hosting site:
  * You will not be able to process anything
  * The Virtual Assistant will not respond
  * The File Upload Option has been disabled
  * Attempting to process unprocessed data will result in a server error
