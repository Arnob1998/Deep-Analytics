4,1.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer beware; you're in for a rip off.,"







  
  
    So, I did some research and bought this switch because it is advertised as the 'NEW' model with serial number beginning with 'XKW'. It is said to have better battery life, possibly a boosted processor, and generally just be an updated switch model. That being said, the old discontinued model still retails for the same amount. I checked my model on my 'NEW AND IMPROVED' switch, and it is the sane as my 2018 switch XAW. Needless to say, I am rather disappointed in Amazon. I installed all my games, transferred data, and now I am stuck with wiping and returning it or just settling for a mediocre version of the switch. Thanks for the annoyance Amazon! Also, the left Joy-con bumper was broken right out of the box! It was also covered in grease. $300 for outdated switch, and a broken controller. I don't normally leave nasty reviews, but I'm pretty bummed. Also nintendo will switch out the outdated one, but I have to ship it to them!

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Preordered mine Feb 4th and just got it Mar 17th,"







  
  
    Giving the console a low review because of scalpers is NOT okay. The console is beautiful and I can't wait for it to come back into stock and screw over all of the scalpers. But come on people... don't review bomb it because someone is charging way too much for it. That's not fair.

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't listen to 1 star reviews.,"







  
  
    The main reason there are so many 1 star reviews is because When quarantine 1st started there was a price gouge.Now they've lowered it to the original price so you should just ignore those.My son loves it is helping stay in touch with his friends during quarantine and it has a wide variety of fun games.I think that you should should get this for your kids or yourself.😃

    Ordered new model (HAC-001 [01]), with better screen and battery life. Was sent discontinued model HAC-001 instead. New models serial starts with XKW, old starts with XAW. Be aware, I did my research and bought what was advertised as the updated model but got bit instead.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!,"







  
  
    LOVE THE SWITCH!!! This switch is so cute and I honestly can’t wait to play animal crossing on this! The design on this switch is so beautiful like Nintendo did a good job on the color scheme and everything!!! Hopefully this switch keeps restocking so that everyone can get the chance to have their hands on this beauty for the original price and for those SCALPERS to stop raising the prices on the switch. (BTW for those scalpers reading this y’all are truly disgusting and selfish for not letting people who actually want the handheld system get their hands on it)

"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brand New Animal Crossing Edition Switch for MSRP,"







  
  
    For anyone looking to get an Animal Crossing Edition Switch without paying more than retail price, my advice is to be patient and check back here frequently. At random times, a few consoles will be restocked and available for MSRP (thank you to the other customers in the Q&A who tipped me off about this!). Just a couple minutes after coming across that advice, I refreshed the page to test it out and this is exactly what happened. Originally it said it would take over a month to arrive but I ended up receiving it less than a week later. Just make sure the listing says ""Ships from and sold by Amazon.com"" to ensure it's not a third party seller and that the price is exactly $299.99.In terms of the product itself, I had already been playing on another Switch for a while and it's a great console (aside from the infamous joycon drift issue). My preferred play style is docked on the TV but it works perfectly on handheld mode as well. The Animal Crossing edition is super cute with its pastel joycons and ACNH-themed dock, I highly recommend it!
  
"
2,1.0 out of 5 stars,NO NEED to buy if you are not a super fan,"







  
  
    If you are not a super fan of animal corssing then I think you can just get the normal one. The price just go crazy and it doesn't worth it. If you really whant a cool colour one you can DIY. The photo is form my friend, it is not so hard to change those shell. You can buy the shells even on Amazon (though my friend get them from somewhere else).

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful console,"







  
  
    I was able to place an order for this beautiful console the day of release during a brief period when they were available for the actual retail price of $299.99 and not for some inflated cost.  The console arrived today and in great condition. The driver handed it to me directly, which was wonderful. The colors of JoyCons are two of my favorites and are quite peaceful to look at. The dock is adorable. A refreshing alternative to the standard black. As soon as I took the Switch out of the box I applied a tempered glass screen protector on it.  I was also able to transfer user data and save data over from my old Switch to this new one. Something I wasn’t aware I could do, which was a very nice surprise. I really hope they get more of these beautiful consoles in stock soon for the rest of the Animal Crossing fans.

     Thought I wouldn’t be able to learn how to use this system because as a child my parents never bought things such as these. Therefore I have zero gaming skills LOL! Any away, It’s been fun using it. I thought it would lay there untouched but my son and I are addicted to Mario kart so we use it daily. My son is 4 and he’s an expert gamer, or so he says! No really he beats my butt! So if you have a little one under 6 they may surprise you!

"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Elegant compromise between handheld and console,"







  
  
    In terms of raw horsepower (CPU, graphics, whatever) the Nintendo Switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the XBox One.  But, the Switch is a unique device.  As a handheld, it is quite powerful (the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld's battery life, addressing the Switch's greatest weakness).  This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability.Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it.  Software is what makes or breaks a console, no matter how good it is.For example the Zelda game ""Breath of the Wild"" is a visual stunner with a huge open world.  And this is the first portable system that has the full version of Skyrim available for it (the reason I bought it --- a high quality port of Skyrim with the 3 add-on packs).  Nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as ""Mario Kart 8"" as well as a lot of new titles such as ""Super Smash Brothers Ultimate"" or ""Luigi's Mansion 3"".In addition,their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as Stardew Valley.Also, if you purchase the Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20/year) Nintendo also gives you a large selection of NES and SNES classic games.  The membership is worthwhile for that alone.Basically, because Nintendo is ONLY selling the Switch as a current console (the 3DS is on its way out), all of their best software goes to the one console.  And that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well.If you want a wide variety of games, the Switch is a good choice.  If you want THE best console graphics or performance, obviously the Switch isn't for you.

9,1.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced! Don't pay more than $300 for it.,"







  
  
    I love my switch. So much so that my girlfriend has started wanting to use it too and I suggested she look into getting her own since she just bought a game but has no console of her own. We have looked everywhere and now they seem to be selling for $500 instead of the $300 that is normal. This should not be happening in a pandemic where people just want to stay home!So as to reduce the number of price gougers:AMAZON, PLEASE LIMIT THE NUMBER OF CONSOLES THAT A SINGLE ACCOUNT OR CREDIT CARD CAN BUY!

     Loved the product initially as it was a Christmas gift.  The design (Animal Crossings) was cute, my favorite colors.  I’ve only played it a dozen or so times.  Owned by an adult (well taken care of).  Three months after purchasing it will NOT turn on.  I’ve replaced the power cord hoping that was why it wouldn’t charge.  Tried charging it on the cradle as well as directly plugged into the charging cord.  No success with either.  The unit will not power on.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful Switch - Definitely worth the buy if you can find one,"







  
  
    Definitely love how bright the colors are on this switch, more of a neon pastel shade. The switch is the V2, which has extended battery life and a more efficient CPU. Comparing this switch the the V1, the IPS panel has a warmer tint whereas the V1 is much brighter. Though color values do vary across switches. The joycons themselves are more of a matte finish on the coating rather than the glossy feel on previous joycons. The colors match well with the dock and will definitely stand out by your TV. The dock itself is a bit wider compared to the V1 allowing more wiggle room to prevent the switch from being scratched, though I do recommend purchasing a glass screen protector. The pattern on the back of the switch definitely gives it an ""animal crossing"" feel to showcasing. They did a really good job in making the pattern stand out compared to previous special edition switches.Overall, pretty happy with having a new switch that stands out and has a longer battery life. Will definitely be a well-used switch in the coming months.

    It's suck a jerk move to raise the price by 200 plus dollars. Take the extra 200 and live a terrific life you jerk. Only reason I bought from you is because a) only one I could find b) it was my neices birthday and she's extremely sick. That's all she asked for but people like you do what you do best and upcharge.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Won my sisters heart!,"







  
  
    Alright so since the Covid-19 outbreak has officially ruined my sisters senior year she had started getting into animal crossing. After playing on the I Phone app for what felt like forever she decided she wanted to transition to a game on the 3ds console. Since she had started playing animal crossing new leaf she fell in love with the series. So as her big sister I had decided I would get her this limited edition themed switch in hopes of helping with her depression as well as to cheer her up for her senior year being ruined. Also so she could get a taste of Animal Crossing new horizons for when it comes out March 20th, 2020!  The day I told her I purchased it she hopped with joy. I was excited too considering I was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister. It had finally arrived. Its box didn't come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages. It works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself. The only concerns I have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use. This is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you're trying to play a game after a year after consistant use. So I'd be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case.All I have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn't be happier with her early senior graduation gift!

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,DO NOT BUY FOR ANYTHING ABOVE $299!! (boo scalpers),"







  
  
    I am so grateful I did not give into the scalpers... I know how unfair and unfortunate the scalping situation is, but the console itself really is not worth anything but $299 (plastic and basic). Please consider trying sites like stockinfo (where I finally got mine after like a month of searching) and save that money for all the games you’ll want :) Plus sticking it to the scalpers out there once it becomes widely available again makes the wait so much more worth it in my opinion!

    Spent several days during the COVID-19 pandemic searching high and low for a Switch anywhere.  Most of what was available were 3rd party sellers charging $100 to even $200 over market value which is asinine.  Missed a couple stocks at Best Buys that sold out in seconds.Finally I just put on Netflix and had Amazon open and kept refreshing.  Missed a couple then finally had some used listings straight from Amazon for get this, $280!Order was delivered in two days.  Came in original box and had everything in packaging basically like it was new.  Screen had a protrctive film which was cool.  All controllers and adapters were nicely placed in plastic sleeves.  Everything was pretty much flawless.  The only thing is one joy con had barely any battery and the other was dead.  Not a huge deal got it charged in dock quickly.Everything was factory reset and when I started it up it was like it had never been turned on.DON'T BE SCARED TO BUY USED! AND DON'T LET THOSE PRICE GOUGERS TAKE YOUR MONEY!PATIENCE IS A VIRTUE! I was diligent for not even 48 hours and just kept checking and refreshing and eventually it paid off!

Patience paid off and I'm so glad that Nintendo released another round of this.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,the animal crossing switch is legit!! 5⭐️ STARS!!,"







  
  
    Don’t be discouraged by the 1⭐️ star reviews; this is the real deal! You’re only allowed one animal crossing switch per amazon account to allow most people to get their hands on it without the extreme price gouge. The switch looks beautiful while docked & i’m a fan on the pastel blue/green & cream colored contrast. If you already played AC on another switch console, you’re now able to backup & transfer all of your save data by contacting Nintendo support. It’s a little tedious but, worth it if you have 100+ hours of hard work. 10/10 recommend to those who have been trying to get their hands on this in months! (GREAT HOLIDAY OR BIRTHDAY GIFT IDEA)

    EDIT; added photos so you all can see this beautiful switch!I have waited for this particular switch since it came out in March 2020, the Animal Crossing Edition switch!Firstly,  this switch is a gorgeous color and the little animal crossing details are super cute!Now, the switch started up fine and hasn't given me any problems yet, it charges as it should (got to my house on low battery) and the joycon attachments seem to work properly! It's super cool being able to control the switch with the Joycon not being attached!I played Mario Kart 8 on my switch and it runs beautifully! Everything works as it should!
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,It has its pros & cons..but more pros!,"







  
  
    I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game.There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo’s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they’re splattering paint all over each other.However the Switch also has its cons. Let’s start with Nintendo’s “E-Shop”. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony’s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It’s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it’s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.5/5 Stars

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST B-DAY PRESENT EVER !!!,"







  
  
    We bought this for my 7-year-old son's birthday & he couldn't be happier!! This is by far the most adorable Nintendo switch console out there!! I definitely recommend purchasing it.We bought it when it was $300 plus tax. I do not recommend paying any more than that price.. just wait till it gets back in stock & buy it for $300. Do not purchase it from greedy scalpers.. keep an eye out because as soon as it gets in stock it sells out usually the same day! We are so fortunate we were able to get one in time for my son's birthday ..we purchased this back in October & held on to it till December for his birthday. If you want one for Christmas, I doubt you will be able to get one at the $300 price ..unfortunately it's sold out till mid January.. but if you can I say go ahead & get it! This thing is adorable & really is a great collector item for any Nintendo fan! Even if they aren't into animal crossing. It is a very unisex design. I believe it can be for a boy or a girl. 👍

    It's good thing that was able to get Nintendo Switch for $299.99 few weeks ago and it arrived this week. Beautiful Nintendo Switch- Animal Crossing: New Horizon Special Edition console.It looks awesome with colors and design, and it works excellent at my home. I like that they have few free to play games and that they have SNES and NES games from Nintendo E-Shop. I can't wait to get Animal Crossing game someday. Hope they Add more free-to-play games on Nintendo Switch, add Twitch streaming app, and more apps for gamers, and be able to use bluetooth devices and console controllers with bluetooth.Hope they make more awesome and beautiful special editions designs and art Nintendo Switch consoles in the future and with 4k/8k graphics, audio, and UHD quality.Overall awesome console to own and have with my other different home consoles to play with my family and myself.

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,👍HDMI out to bigger screen and removable joycons!⭐⭐⭐⭐,"







  
  
    Definitely worth the extra hundred compared to the smaller switch lite.joycons fit and feel more ergonomic in palm and extra inch in screen is nice.I tried the switch lite first and the one main point that made me return and spend extra on this is the replacable joycons is buttons wear out. Though is nice that the lite version still allows for the pro controller to be wirelessly connected to it as well as the bigger original (OG) switch. :)I hope the next switch and switch lite version don't change much, but nintendo please update and allow the USB-C to be the video out on both.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Such a cute switch! I love it!,"







  
  
    I couldn't believe my luck when I was able to snag one at MSRP after the release date. It's so cute! I like the design of this one much better than the other switches, and the dock is adorable, especially if you're an Animal Crossing fan. And it's the newer version with improved battery life, too! I was thinking about getting a switch for a while, but the lack of games I absolutely had to have and the colors (I'm not a big fan of the standard colors/designs) put me off. Animal Crossing solved both of these problems with ACNH and this amazing special edition.My only complaint (other than how difficult it was to get - finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than 5 minutes) is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap. It's probably just an issue with mine in particular, but it does make it kind of annoying to remove. I have to put some force into it, and I'm sure that one of these days, I'll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it. Otherwise, it's very cute, and at MSRP, I'd definitely choose it over the other colors!PS - I hear that this version is restocking, at least in Japan, so absolutely do not buy from scalpers! When I was hunting for this, there were at least 100 being sold by scalpers for ~$500;  now there are just over 20 for $750 each. It's cute, but it's not worth making a scalper $400+ off of other people's desperation. Just wait for a restock, or buy a regular switch and put a skin over it.

    I want to start by getting the obvious out of the way. Scalpers = Trash, and I cannot believe with everything going on right now that Amazon is allowing them to sell at such inflated prices.  Wait for the official Amazon restocks because they charge MSRP, now onto the Switch.Love it. I cannot say that enough.  The console won't blow you away, but it will keep you entertained for hours. Whether you play in docked mode or handheld mode, they both work very well and looks very good on both screens.  The battery on this generation is much improved over the day 1 release.  The battery itself is the same size, but Nintendo put in a more efficient processor which extends the battery life.The game selection is wide and varied, if you like shooters, you can find them here. If you like platformers, look nowhere else, you have some of the greatest ever made. Not just this generation, but former generations in the Nintendo Eshop.The rundown is the Switch is a great console and worth the $299, just wait until Amazon gets it back in stock, stay far away from this worthless scalpers.Last note: Follow @FatKidAlerts on Twitter, he is always keeping up with Switch stock on Amazon, and that is how I finally got mine for MSRP.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nintendo's best console in a long time,"







  
  
    Sure, it's no PS4 or PS5, but it's an incredible little machine with such incredible versatility in such a tiny package. While it might not have the pure processing power and graphics capability of the other two major systems it does do what Nintendo has done best for a long time, provide a reasonably priced quality portable gaming system. The advantage this time is that the Switch is both a home console and a portable console in one unit. This is something that consoles in general have never really been able to do until now and it's amazing how great the game quality is even in this small form factor.I mean, the Wii was good in the motion control but the gimmick did wear after a bit. The WiiU really felt like a disappointment in that it just didn't bring much to the table and Nintendo clearly wasn't going to be able to compete in the home console market against the other two juggernauts. What Nintendo has always been great at though is dominating the portable gaming market and the switch sees them bringing their expertise in the portable market to the home console market in a power play that really paid off in my opinion.Now, this system does still suffer from some of Nintendo's generally less favorable business practices so do take that in to account. The price for the Switch itself actually isn't that unreasonable so I don't fault them for that whatsoever. The peripherals, on the other hand, really put a dent in the pocketbook if you need to buy anything that didn't come in the box (and you probably will need to at some point, let's be honest). The price of games also comes at a premium just as it has with past Nintendo systems as you will rarely see even older games every discounted or put on sale while such things are very common with the the competing systems. For instances, ""Zelda: Link's Awakening"", which has roughly 13 to 15 hours of content, will still cost you $60 which is incredibly high for a game that offers so little content with little replay value. Sadly Nintendo has a tendency of doing this and always has so do be prepared to pay premium prices for most games with the Switch.All in all I still think the unit is worth it particularly since you just can't find a better portable gaming platform than this. I definitely recommend getting the Switch over the Switch Lite as those are fully integrated and if you bust an analog stick or a button you're pretty much screwed. With a Switch you can replace the side controllers as you need and we all know controller buttons and analog sticks can wear over time so that alone is worth it. I mean, for $100 more you get a heck of a lot better of a system than you do with a lite so I highly recommend going this route if you're looking in to a Switch.

    Originally, I was going to order the nintendo switch lite but no one had it in stock and if it was in stock it was at very much inflated prices. Then I found the regular nintendo switch at a regular price and I'm even more thankful that I settled with the original switch version vs the lite for my kid. (He's 4) He is really thrilled that he can take it room to room and place it on any switch dock we have in that room and instantly start playing on the TV (We have 2 switches). As a 4 year old being able to do that without help from adults gives him the feeling of being independent for him I'm sure. Since getting his device we have bought multiple accessories for it including a case, screen protector (of course!), SD card and a Nintendo switch pro controller all working flawlessly with the switch. Nintendo really made a genius product not only for adults but for littler kids too as my 4 year old can run his system all without help from me which is quite a big deal not having to help someone 24/7. A+ from me and I'm sure if my kid was writing this review he'd give it a A++++++. Good Job Nintendo!

    I am a huge fan of Animal Crossing and at the last minute I decided I had to have this. I ran around and called some places. Ended up getting one of the last ones at my local Wal-Mart. The console is slick and I am not disappointed! I love the colors and I am super glad I decided to get it.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,For the child inside all of us,"







  
  
    I love my Switch, this console really brings me back to my childhood, there is something about it that recaptured that magic I felt playing my Super Nintendo and even the GameCube. I've played every Nintendo console and while I was a major fan of the early ones, after the Cube, I got sucked into the Xbox 360 and then the PS4, but, this console is the first I've played in years that brings me back to that childhood magic. I got this console on a whim after watching Detective Pikachu and realizing how much I missed Pokémon games, so I had to get Let's Go Pikachu and pre-order Pokémon Shield, as well as getting back into Mario, and checking out Fire Emblem Warriors which is totally amazing. All in all, not only are the exclusive games amazing, but, the console and even the joycon controller rig are something special. I can't put my finger on it, and I really can't put it into words, but this is a great system and for kids or those trying to rediscover the child inside of them, this is a must have. Just don't try to get inside a child with this is, or you're going to jail sicko.

It was sold out everywhere but now thanks to my dad I have it for Christmas eve  when we open the gifts I Am so ecstatic and excited for Christmas eve thanks Nintendo for the best switch ever but it does not include the game  but that's ok because I already have it but if you are going to get this for your kids or for yourself for family fun avoid scalpers I hate them they suck also if you want  buy the switch and game itself it is a great game and I guarantee you will have a blast playing it

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Take it anywhere,"







  
  
    I used to play Nintendo 64 back in the day and now I have another Nintendo product that I love.I play my Switch every single day. Mostly Animal Crossing at the moment, but I change it up sometimes. The only thing is the price of the games. They have sales all the time for various games on the shop but a lot of the bigger name games aren't included those. Or if they are the ""sale"" is pretty negligible.The things I love the most about the Switch is that you can take it pretty much anywhere. To my friend's house when we hang out, on long car trips, outside, you name it. The other thing I love is how durable the system is. I have dropped it at least three times on hardwood floor and tile and it hasn't affected the performance at all.Great little game system. It's an investment, for sure,  but if you're going to play it every day then it's worth it.

    This made a fantastic gift for a gamer couple. We now both have one and play regularly.I didn't realize there were so many big name games for switch! When I first got on the console I expected it to be all Nineltendo games, but other developers like Bethesda have been adding content to the platform as well. Some great sales happen for non-Nintendo games too! We've gotten Minecraft, Outer Worlds, Skyrim (which works great with the joycons!), The Witcher III, Pokemon, BOTW, and Burnout, and they've all been great. The console works really well, just don't forget to get a large micro-sd memory card! You don't have to get the Nintendo brand ones, in fact I recommend SanDisk Extreme Pro, as they're larger size for the money and are extremely reliable. Same brand I use in my professional sony cameras that I use to produce films and documentaries!

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,BEST NINTENDO CONSOLE!,"







  
  
    I've always loved Nintendo and every console that they've made but this one, really makes it to the top of my list! It's portable, light-weight and, pretty thin. Also, Amazon has a ton of cute cases to choose from so that you can bring your console for when you're on-the-go. The buttons feel comfortable to the slightest touch, everything feels smooth. Even the joysticks and trigger buttons have no resistance so there's no need to press them too hard. Easy to set up, there's a shop on the main menu for you to purchase games straight from your console and you can find people online to play with for your favorite Nintendo Switch games. I seriously love my Nintendo Switch and, everyone should get one today!

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Product is great! Resellers... not so much!,"







  
  
    TLDR: Product is SO CUTE!! BUT doesn’t do anything special compared to a regular Switch (other than give 10/10 on aesthetic) so don’t buy unless you can afford it/the look it worth it to you.Long review:This product is amazing!! The pastel colors are so cute and the texture on the back adds a great extra touch. The dock has an AC graphic on it which was a great addition tomy living room! The packaging is also well thought out leading to a great unboxing experience. Of course this works exactly like every other Nintendo switch, so this is entirely about aesthetic.With all of that said, the price gouging on this product is insane. Because it is a limited edition the reselling price is crazy, and because it does nothing a normal Switch can’t do, so purchasing this is a novelty. If you have the cash to drop go for it (I was lucky enough to get one at the normal price). But as I was hunting one down when they were first announced, I watched people buy them up and list them at inflated prices before it even came out. So maybe consider if you want to give those people your money.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,First Time Nintendo Switch User,"







  
  
    As someone who's been playing on the PS4, the Nintendo Switch is a great change of pace. This is my ever handheld gaming device and I got to say, man is it impressive!For starters, the design of the switch is awesome, not too heavy or light. Every time you slip the joycons on the side of the switch, it makes a satisfying click sound. The dock is great for playing games on your TV or monitor (plus it looks clean too). After spending about 10 hours on the switch, I am satisfied with the joycons and feel no need to purchase the pro controller. Although the joycons are a bit small (perfect for kids), they will get the job done. Next, it is important that you take storage into consideration since the switch only comes with a base of 32 gb. I bought the SanDisk 128 gb card and that will be enough for me. If you plan on playing games like Mortal Kombat, I'd suggest upgrading to 200 and above, since those games take up more storage (ex. MK11 Aftermath is 30 gb). Depending on how much you play, battery life will vary. Of course, more labor-intensive games will drain the battery quicker. I only have two games on my switch so far (Attack on Titan and Fortnite) and those games tend to drain the battery significantly faster. I don’t have any other games to compare to, but while playing AoT, the battery lasted about 4-5 hours before needing a charge. This is super impressive since AoT is an open-world style game with dozens of titans running around the map destroying buildings and such, but frames will drop from time to time if there too much going on at once. Even after playing for a long time, the switch is only some-what warm, which is great if you are playing in handheld mode. Lastly, I want to talk about the price point of the switch. The retail price is $299.99 and that's what I paid for when I bought the Mario Version. It's a steep price since it's alongside the price point of an Xbox or PS4, but it is worth it if you enjoy playing games on the go and love Nintendo titles such as Zelda and Mario. In addition to the retail price of the console, also take into account other expenses such as extra storage (I would only buy the ones from Nintendo, SanDisk, or Samsung), a screen protector (very important in my opinion. The first thing I did when I unboxed the switch was to put on a screen protector), extra controllers and/or joycons, and maybe Nintendo's online membership if you want to play online and with friends (games like Fortnite will not need a membership).All in all, the switch is a great device and I can't recommend it enough. It's a great console for families or if you just want to play alone.
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy it for the exclusives or don't buy it at all.,"







  
  
    If you look at Nintendo's list of exclusive games and think, ""Yeah, I'm all about that"", dive in. This is a fun console that offers play on your TV screen or handheld (switch... duh). With multiple controller configuration options including extra peripherals that will make your controller become a steering wheel, a golf club, a fishing pole, and a fitness ring just to name a few, there is a lot of fun and creativity built into Nintendo's latest console.Add to all of this, with a Nintendo Online subscription you get access to tons of free and low cost games. They have included a virtual NES and SNES console with a good selection of classic games. There are also other free games like Tetris 99 and the new Super Mario 35 which are loads of fun. There are also lots of other games that can be had for as little as $2.99If however you're looking for a console to play the latest cross platform hits, you're probably better off with a PC or one of the next gen gaming consoles. Playing a big cross platform game, you will notice a difference in graphics quality. The Switch only displays in HD, while every other console (and pc) is up to 4K now. Plus the Nintendo controllers, while fun and creative, will not hold up to long term play for something like a FPS. They are fun controllers, and work perfectly for the Nintendo games, but they feel like they would ultimately break after a few serious button mashing sessions. If you've seen all the drama about controller drift, you now know why.Bottom line is if you're all about Nintendo exclusives like Mario, Zelda, Animal Crossing, Metroid? (please?), get this console. It will provide a great deal of entertainment. If you're trying to play the big gaming hits available across all consoles and PC, there are better options.

    The switch is already of my favorite consoles I’ve ever owned. As an adult-I’ve been surprised by how much I play it in handheld mode. It’s nice to be able to sneak in some gaming time here and there at work when there is some downtime. And I actually find myself playing it in handheld mode pretty often at home when I’m watching football on the weekends. I’m glad I waited until this model with the improved battery life came out. Sometimes, I don’t have to put it on the dock to charge for 5 or 6 days, assuming I’m playing 30 minutes here and there. I highly recommend this system.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money wait and hunt.,"







  
  
    Ok. The Switch is a masterpiece when it comes to the library. I’ve spent more time than I would like to admit playing Breath of the Wild. Smash Ultimate is the best in the series, along with Mario maker 2.The resolution is a problem for some other hardcore gamers, but HD is fine for me. I really don’t care if it’s not “4K, 60fps”.The controls are super advanced. Li always play with the grip, even if Motion controls are recommended. I don’t personally own a Pro controller for the switch, but I’ll consider it. I have a Wii U Pro-controller which is my favorite controller for the system.The Switch approves upon the Wii U in most ways. The Wii U does however possess a better UI, more comfortable controls, and Virtual console.Overall the Nintendo Switch is worth the hunt and the money. The console has the best library since the N64.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,The cutest!,"







  
  
    Needless to say, the Nintendo Switch is so much fun and a great way to kill time.  But on top of that, this particular console's Animal Crossing theme is just the cutest I've ever seen.  I never liked the primary-looking colors of the OG console, so the soft blue and mint green joy con colors really appealed to me.  The back of the switch itself has rivers and islands etched onto it as well!  It's the little details that really make a difference for me.  The dock is a light cream color with the raccoon travel agents on the bottom right.  I'm so glad this set was available again because, although I'm sure I'd be happy with the OG console, I'm so much happier with my Animal Crossing edition.  It makes me smile every time I see it.  I've never even played the game before I bought it, but it ended up being my first game purchase and it makes me even more happy that I bought this edition.  I love it!

    This is my third switch so that I can have three Animal Crossing islands because I’m insane, also I have severe ocd - same thing I guess?, and I am absolutely in love with the AC theme. I have a different style/color for each one so I can tell the islands apart but this one is def my fave. The Switch is my console. I have played a couple of games on ps4 (Atelier games that weren’t out on Switch until more recently), but now that those games are on Switch I will get them as soon as they go on sale. I love the handheld option because I can play while my husband watches something on our tv, and I love that it can also be docked so I can see things on the big screen. I play mostly handheld. It plays smoothly with the joycons and a pro controller. You can even play with a pro controller when it’s not docked if you don’t want to/can’t use the joycons. I’m sorry about the novella. It’s just enjoyable and I recommend it.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,This switch saved my marriage.. for now.,"







  
  
    This is my second purchase of a Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing edition. I was bummed out when my wife took my switch hostage claiming it for herself to play Animal Crossing, especially since Monster Hunter Rise had just come out. I was even more bummed out because I had missed out on buying the MHR switch edition because my rationale mind decided I didn’t need a second switch. I was left with 2 options, leave my wife & fight for custody of the switch or purchase another during the shortage brought by on by the epidemic. Surprisingly after a few months of contemplating my decision the switch prices went back down to an affordable price. It still wasn’t easy finding a switch in stores so I took to the internet where I was surprised to see a brand new switch going for regular price. I quickly added the item to my cart & purchased right away! It was delivered with upmost care like a stork bringing me a new baby. Everything was brand new, I was taken back to a simpler time in my life, opening presents on Christmas day. Finally after a quick software update I could play MHR months after its release! Little to my surprise my wife quit playing Animal Crossing shortly after I got my new switch because she went down Korean Drama rabbit hole on Netflix..

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nintendo coming back to greatness,"







  
  
    For quite some time Nintendo has been underwhelming when it comes to hardware specs on consoles. To the point that I switched to buying only the handhelds after the Gamecube. With the jump to an Nvidia GPU, not only does the bar for graphics get bumped up significantly from what Nintendo has released recently, it also allows third-party title developers the ability to bring their fun games to Nintendo for releases.Let's state that this isn't as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but still has very good graphics. Not only that, but being able to undock it and play it like a handheld is an awesome feature. Switch Online, a service needed for online gaming, also includes NES and SNES titles you can play for free (included in the price really). My ONE issue, is that chat is needed through an external app. If this is done so the playing experience online requires less bandwidth in the rooms and therefore is smoother on the servers, than it makes sense. Otherwise, seems a bit annoying to have to need another device for it.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nintendo Switch #2,"







  
  
    Here is what happened. I already had a Nintendo Switch but I didn’t play with it for a few months so when I wanted to use it it had no power. I put it on the dock to charge and nothing. I thought it was dead forever so I ordered a new one from Amazon. Later I went to see if my old Nintendo would power up after I charged it. What I was not doing is pushing in the power button enough, after I pushed the Nintendo powered up. So now I own 2 Nintendo’s. It’s great to have 2. This new NS works great just like the old one. I could care the less about the game Animal Crossing but I like how the NS looks. Also there was waiting time if I wanted the exact one I have. Over all the NS is great! In fact I like it better then Sony play Station or X-box I don’t even play them anymore. I love it I can play the old games from Nintendo and others. The first game I played was PONG back in the day. Nintendo Rocks!!!

    I’m late to the switch party, but so glad I came. Haha. It’s 100% worth it. I got the gray, so it’d be more subtle. Figuring out how it works is very easy & it’s quick to catch on. I have downloaded all the classic mario games, YouTube & Hulu. It’s SUCH a throwback to see all the classics again & hear those familiar sounds. The Nintendo membership is only $20 a year, which gives you access to all those free classics, so in my opinion, it’s absolutely worth it. I use it everyday, whether to watch movies, or play games. I love it so much & would highly recommend.

    The Animal Crossing Switch is just beautiful. I love the colors and the details in the design. The system I received works great and was as described. I actually received it a day ahead of schedule, which is amazing for this time if year (close to Christmas).Right now, due to Covid, most sellers are raising prices on these systems. Especially with these special edition ones. Most other listings for the Animal Crossing Switch have been almost double the normal price, so I’m really grateful to have gotten one from this seller for the standard retail price. This made my Christmas.

    My nine-year-old son saved and worked in order to buy a Nintendo Switch. He bought it with his own money and I couldn't be prouder of him. We bought the Animal Crossing edition only because it would have been available earlier than the standard version. He said he didn't care how it looked as long as it could play Switch games. Originally, Amazon delivered a completely unrelated package and said it was the Switch, but their customer service sent the replacement as soon as the issue was reported. Kudos to Amazon for that. My son has only used it in handheld mode since there isn't a TV available for his use. He has never placed it in the dock so I don't know how that would work. We've had it for a couple of weeks at this point. Here is my son's review:I like it. It's been good so far. Its most impressive feature is the battery life. One charge can last for six hours of continuous gameplay. It also charges more quickly than any other device I've ever had. It goes from around 4% to 25% in 10 to 15 minutes. I'm happy I bought it.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the ACNH switch,"







  
  
    Call me crazy.....I bought the original switch a while ago and never played Animal Crossing before. When everyone was talking about New Horizon during the start of the Pandemic, I thought to give it a shot. Boy, I should not have done it :) I started spending all my free time paying off my loans to Tom Nook, hunting for villagers and trying to decorate my Island. Like many, I got kinda bored after everything was unlocked and got tired of the Villagers repeating the same over and over again. I thought of resetting my Island, but didn't want to lose everything I had worked for so hard. Then Nintendo announce to release the ACNH special edition switch again and beside I didn't like the idea of buying another switch, it was a great opportunity to start another Island with an ACNH themed switch. Anyway, I didn't regret spending another $299 - the switch is VERY cute and fits perfectly on my shelf. Beside still having my old switch with a developed, but basically abandoned  Island I mostly play on the new ACNH switch now. I know it's very hard to reset your Island, but if you don't have the money to buy another system, you may want to consider it. Starting from scratch actually  does bring a lot of the lost magic back.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great overall system for gaming with friends!,"







  
  
    Similar to other Nintendo systems, innovation is always attached to their new ideas. The joy cons are similar to the wii remotes, albeit not as precise for some games where they were used for shooting type games, the joy cons are incredible for multiplayer. I honestly prefer using one joycon whenever I can when playing games, it's really nifty being able to play two player automatically with a friend or family member without having to pay for an expensive controller, or a cheaper built one.Nintendo Apps are so-so at the moment, it would be great to have streaming apps such as Netflix for streaming, but other apps such as Youtube have worked well streaming but I do not like the interface for searching for videos.When playing online, after paying for a year subscription, was not as bad as the days of the Nintendo Wii, but it could be better. Wifi play has always been a struggle for companies and consumers that I don't expect to go away with any patch made by Nintendo. Buying the year subscription also includes many nes/snes games you can play with the joy cons in single/multiplayer. My roommate got rehooked playing super mario world and it was a blast seeing someone who says they ""hate games with bad graphics"".Overall, if you're looking for a system for on the go or for a house hold device, the Nintendo Switch is a excellent system with a good range of games to play on. My young nephew and kid siblings are a fan of it; and same for me and several of my friends who are in our early 20s.

    I've had the light for a while, but it started drifting and playing animal crossing with a drift is no fun at all. Especially when u can't switch out the joycons I also wanted to start my island over so it was about time to get a new switch. As I was looking I was so lucky to see the animal crossing special edition back in stock and not at a scalping price. But at the normal price of 299.99, but when the first package was delivered it got stolen because Amazon delivery didn't know, customer service at first had an aditude with me. I had assume they didn't believe me that it was stolen. But it was and at the end of the day. Im so grateful they were able to replace the console with out Me having to get my money back because I saw that the price instantly jump from 299.99 to 360.00 which I would never recomend buying it at that price.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Be Patient!,"







  
  
    I got this Gray version of the Nintendo Switch after a few months of hunting for retail price $299. There's a couple of websites out there that will notify you of in-stock. I happened to be able to grab it off of Amazon, but GameStop, Target, Walmart, Best Buy, etc, also have them as well. With it being in stock is rare, so you just have to look and be patient! Plan a few months ahead for birthday / xmas gifts so you have time to wait for a retail priced stock is in. Enough about the INSANE price gouging....I am very pleased with the Switch and am very happy with it. I have played on it for a week so far and everything is working fine and dandy, as it should. One gripe is that the storage capacity is small so only a few games can be played at a time, but with a micro SD card, possibilities are endless. I ordered one of those, and expect it soon so I can expand my downloaded game collection. I've enjoyed the Switch so much I'm getting some additional joycons and a grip and a charging station. I'm going to continue looking for accessories. Maybe a case I also had to get a TV adapter because my old TV only has one HDMI port, so I had to RCA to HDMI it up in order to not unplug and replug my Roku every time I want a bigger screen. How that goes is yet to be determined.I'm still figuring out how the dock station works (TV debacle), but for the most part - no complaints! I haven't played it with more than one person yet, but I'm positive that runs smoothly as well!

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best gaming console!!,"







  
  
    I cannot rave about the Switch enough!!! It truly is one of the best gaming consoles. I never was really a big “gamer” but always enjoyed Nintendo games such as Mario Kart and other related games. This console is great for both kids and adults, it is also great for solo or multiplayer games. I absolutely love the convenience of being able to play either on the big screen or handheld mode. The battery life on the handheld is pretty good for it being a larger sized console but if you’re playing for multiple hours I will need to be charged. All in all this truly was one of the best purchases I’ve made for entertainment. I highly recommend this console to everyone of all ages!

Not happy, also Nintendo fix it shop is down with the virus so they wont fix anything until this is done.  I know because when I went online to try to get it to work it was one of the notifications I got.  I have to wonder if there is any quality control, a new product that costs this much should work.

    Okay so this is going to be a review with my overall experience. Yes, it was overpriced, I think this was worth it, I personally got it for the Joy-cons, and I don't regret it, because you really don't know when you will get the opportunity to get one for less. Anyways, arrived in perfect condition, first switch ever, the only thing that was wrong is the Left Bumper on the Joy-con, which i don't know how to explain it but kind of loose, more than the Right Bumper. It bothers me because of something on the inside, and also since I paid a lot for this switch but not enough to complain, its just something i'll have to live with. But besides that, it was a great experience, the bumper was the only thing that gave me a fright since it feels very weird. Now I don't have anything to play since my game doesn't arrive until Wednesday, but just downloading free games is fun, but originally there is only 25gb so I would recommend getting a micro SD, but i think that's all.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nintendo Switch,"







  
  
    It's really nice to take your console game anywhere you want! It sucks that Nintendo didn't give us enough storage space, so make sure you buy a microSD card to store your games and their content. I read that it's better to buy the physical game discs. They take up less space, but if you want to download all of your games go for it. If you play a medium amount of games I would recommend the 256GB - 512GB microSD cards. There is a 1TB microSD card on amazon for around $300.00. Get this one if you're a hardcore Nintendo player. There are many accessories on amazon to also decorate your Switch. You can decorate the controllers with skins or buy the different color joy-cons. The exclusive Pickachu one has nice Pichachu designs on the stand, and I think there's also an Eevee version both from Japan that cost $500 or more. You can also buy the Switch Lite which seems much more available now with the pandemic raging. Explore and find the version of Switch that works for you.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,LOVE IT!! Worth the wait to buy it for original Nintendo price,"







  
  
    Love my new Nintendo Switch Animal Crossing version. I have been waiting for over a year for this. I originally ordered the regular version but it never came so I went to reorder and found that this was finally available. So glad I finally got it. After a year I would have taken anything...my luck - this one was available. So easy to set up. So easy to use. So very happy with the Amazon customer service and the Nintendo Switch. Don’t buy from scalpers who buy cheap and jack up the price. Just wait patiently. Worth the wait.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Be patient it’s worth the wait.,"







  
  
    I was so lucky!!! I happened to randomly check one morning after I had already given up on my search for a switch at retail price and THEY WERE IN STOCK FOR 299!! (sold by amazon) I nearly cried of happiness and immediately bought it. It took a week and a couple days to get here, there was a delay in my delivery. I was worried they had sold me a sold out switch but nope it came in! Just hold on and be patient and don’t buy from these greedy scalpers. A few things about the system itself:The stand is hard to pop out if you don’t have nails (especially if you bite your nails like me) so I bought a stand for it. The game cartridge part is a little hard to take out at first too and I thought I broke It but it’s flimsy plastic so it bends.The controllers are kinda small if you have larger hands.I would also recommend a screen protector, carrying case, and a stand (so you don’t have to keep opening the kickstand it comes with)
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great for younger kids or mobile gaming.,"







  
  
    This is, strangely enough, the first portable system I have ever bought in my 30+ years of gaming. I’ve actually bought 2 Switches so far. The first one was a Christmas present for my son who I was trying to ease into video games. He loves it. After him having it for a year and me occasionally playing it to help him through areas where my greater experience with games could help get through certain areas, I was tempted to get one for myself to play when I had long periods of downtime at work. When Witcher 3 came out for the switch, I bought another one for me and have been playing it a few times per week since.My experience with the console is pretty much strictly in the handheld mode. I bought a Satisfye grip and case for my switch which allows me to hold the system more comfortably than I would without it. Holding the standard system and playing for more that 20 minutes or so causes my hands to cramp. The small joycons are just too small for adult male hands to use for long without some discomfort. I’m fine with that since the small size makes the system easier for kids, like my son, to use. A regular controller can be a bit bulky for a grade school age kid to use well. With the case and grip, this system is perfect for me to throw into my vehicle at work and forget about it until things slow down when I’m waiting for a call. Then I can break it out and pass the time in style.All in all, I have no complaints about the system, my son loves it and uses it constantly. I like it for its portable nature and surprising computing power. It is the first portable system I’ve experienced that didn’t feel like a downgrade or gimmick. The Switch instead feels like a true portable version of a larger console like PS4 or XB1. I still play on my PS4 far more than I do the Switch, but I can’t take that system to work and play in the office or car. If you have young kids, or a desire to game on the go with something better than your phone, then it’s hard to go wrong with the switch.

    I finally caved and got one (of course at retail price. It’s great so far, I love it. The box came on time and in good condition. Very easy set-up!I’ve never had a console before, so this is my first official one!! I was considering between this and the lite, but I think it’s totally worth it getting this one. I like to have the option to play it on my TV. I also didn’t think the switch screen would be that big but it’s actually a decent size.The controllers are so bright, especially the red. I wasn’t expecting neon pink. I’ve seen videos and pictures of the switch, but it’s nothing compared to seeing it in-person.I was iffy about buying it on Amazon, even if it was from Amazon themselves instead of resellers, but this turned out great.

    I originally bought a Nintendo switch lite because this console was sold out everywhere and I desperately wanted to play Animal Crossing during this pandemic. I would literally check every month (since April) to see if maybe a store had this in stock, but sadly at the time, it was only third-party sellers selling at a huge markup price.By October, I decided to check one last time hoping that someone was selling at a decent price and to my surprise Amazon and several other retailers had this back in stock! Bought it right away because from my understanding this was supposed to be a limited edition item and didn’t want to miss the opportunity to own it.Got it in no time and I love it. It’s such a pretty color. It came around a good time since a lot of Switch games have gone on sale for the holiday. I still solely use my switch lite for Animal Crossing, but use my new switch for all other games.No regret purchasing it.

    Hey, it's a Nintendo for 2021. It's fast, simple, and the games are clean. No long loading times and the controls are fairly intuitive. Battery life on the joy-cons is great, though the handheld version is a little lackluster... that's fixed by treating it like a standard console though... so yay.Only real sticking point is the price. For 300 bucks, it feels a bit steep. Many of the games feel like time-eaters for casual players, and there's no browsing or media to speak of. Again though, this is Nintendo and as a game console, it plays games. They play smoothly and have a very finished feel to them. Sign of the times and all that.Overall, a very nice machine if you just want to sit down and play without all the bells and whistles.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tons of games to choose from,"







  
  
    Great system.  My son owns one but has it with him at college so I decided to get one for myself and I must say it's got such a huge selection of games.  I still have my 3ds but didn't realize how much Nintendo had expanded on game selection and variety. I'm a huge animal crossing fan so I bought this version of Switch since I played the first one on the 3ds.  Their online eshop, accessible through an online connection, has an almost endless selection of games.  You can buy physical copies or digital copies of games and some are digital only through the eshop.  As a longtime gamer (I own a PS4 and original owner of a regular NES I bought in 1989), I can honestly say this is Nintendo's best system since you can play it on your TV but also take it with you (portable) like a 3ds.  You can also play games on it offline so you don't have to always be connected to the internet.  This is a console that is great for all ages of people, young or old and when I'm tired of hack and slash on my PS4, the Switch has many chill titles of games to relax with.  I'm 52 and enjoy mySwitch a lot.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful Special Edition!,"







  
  
    I got to admit, I was a little ticked off at Nintendo that the day this switch arrived at my doorstep, they announced the OLED Switch.That being said I am VERY happy with this purchase!  This console is beautiful and is a very nice upgrade to my launch day Switch that died last month.  Throw on a couple of pretty cases to help protect this and you have an amazing set up on your hands.  Nintendo has always made high quality consoles and special editions like this Animal Crossing Switch help showcase that very well.  Now even though the OLED was announced as well, it looks like the same specs just with a better screen.  Very nice for those who prefer handheld mode.  I use mine in the dock most of the time so I didn't really need that.TLDR: If you want a really nice Special Edition Switch then don't be dismayed by the OLED announcement.... the Animal Crossing console is very nice and well worth the money. 👌

    The new battery life is amazing. I bought this for my significant other for our anniversary to play the new Pokemon games on with me. During some preliminary tests right before the games release, hers outlasts my original unit by hours.

And the colors are amazing.

    Wonderful product. There are many minor hiccups that I already knew of before purchasing this product e.g. joycon drift, shakey joycons, hot while docked, online connectivity, dock scratch, etc. However, most of these risks i knew well ahead of time and so I was not bothered by them as most already have a diy fix for them as discovered by the Switch community. Great product, do some research before purchasing one, Nintendo methodology in developing their products can be a little strange at times but the good outweighs the bad with this product.

I bought this last year and gave it away to one of my family members, but then I ended up missing it and decided I wanted it back, so I went and bought myself another one. I guess someone else must have really liked it too because unfortunately it was stolen after a few months of having it; now I have a 3rd Animal Crossing Switch console, and I love it so much. Definitely spend a good amount of time playing Animal Crossing New Horizons, Mario Kart 8, Fire Emblem Three Houses, Final Fantasy X/X-2 Remastered, etc. 110% Recommend

    The Wii and Wii u were cool consoles, but i really only used them to play like mario, or gamecube games on, they were never really used to play ""wii games"". well the switch completely turns my opinion of nintendo consoles around. I have a gameboy advance, and still play the old pokemon games on it from time to time, but the switch is so much more than that. Its like combining all of the good things about a wii, a gameboy advance, and even an old n64, and packing it all into one box, that can even be taken on the go.I am super excited to own one, and i cant wait for more switch games to come out, BOTW, lets go eevee, Smash, the upcoming pokemon sword, and mario odyssey are my definite favorites.THOUGH THEY NEED TO FIX JOYCON DRIFT (sigh)

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,A “can’t miss” for the casual gaming household,"







  
  
    Our household doesn’t buy the latest, greatest gaming systems but it was time to upgrade our original Wii for another family friendly system. The reviews were pretty glowing for the Switch and I can say they’re warranted. Just make sure you buy the newer generation (this product) so you have better battery life and less decline over the life of the product.I love how Nintendo the Parental Controls essentially live within an app on the parent’s phone. A motivated kid can hack just about anything so keeping these settings non-local is a brilliant little safeguard. My kids have to ask me for “more time” when they’ve hit a daily limit (which is customizable for the day of the week). It’s very much like a simpler, more reliable version of Apple’s Screen Time feature on iPhones. Of course, you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code.It’s also worth mentioning that Nintendo did a great job with the “user assisted driving” feature on Mario Kart that helps young kids and inexperienced gamers be competitive. It really is nice to bring my youngest daughter into the joy of Mario Karting.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Lots of fun and takes up very little space,"







  
  
    I've been wanting a Switch for a long time, so I finally went ahead and bought one; and it's been a lot of fun playing with it. I thought the controller would be a little awkward to play with, but it's easy to get the hang of. The only thing I can say is that it's not as ergonomic as an Xbox or even a PS controller, so if you're playing for long stretches of time, your hand will cramp up.I think that the biggest plus for me is how small this thing is - the entire console isn't much bigger than smartphones nowadays, and the games for it are half the size of DVDs. If you're fine with the limited game lineup and just want a console to kill time now and again, this is a great option. It's also not a big commitment space-wise.

Opening this baby was a jumping, dancing celebration. He was very, very happy. The hubby had it up and going easily and quickly, and it went from box to play time in about 30 minutes. Be prepared to spend about $20 at start up to join Nintendo, and you get a couple packs of games, some looked retro to me. The battery life is amazing, seriously.

    The price was good, it came with everything it said it would and it works like it should. I wasn’t expecting to get it for about a month or so but it ended up coming 2 weeks early which was a nice surprise. I see a lot of bad reviews and they’re all mostly because of the price which I think isn’t really fair, saying you got price gouged but you’re the one that paid for it.. it’s not like you thought it’d be 300 and they changed the price to 400 after the fact. If you don’t wanna pay more then wait. I wanted to get this but Amazon was out of stock so I waited a couple days or so n it was back in stock and regular price. Anyway, good price good product.. works just like it said it would. If you’re thinking about getting a switch I would recommend getting an sd card for it cause 32gb isn’t really much and you can get a pretty cheap sd card.. I got one for about 25 bucks with 128gb. 👍👍

It is fun to play in your hand or on your tv... but I will say it doesn't ""consume"" me or grab my attention.  I did set it all up on my own and I am NOT technically brilliant - 60 years old.  If I can do it, you can too.  I had thought that because of the virus I would need some thing new to be a distraction, but I'd rather ride my bike or take a walk!  Ha.

    I know this isn't an Amazon product but I can't start this review without mentioning the awesome job this company does in keeping its customers... <-- which for some reason some other organizations have forgotten, anyways.  I first purchased the Nintendo Switch about 2.5 years ago.  recently, there was a problem with the Switch and it stopped turning on.  I called Amazon, at which time they let me know that I surpasses my warranty on the item.  I immediately was disappointed and than immediately relieved for the next thing the Amazon representative told me was that I was going to be able to receive a $340 refund of the 399 i spent on the item.  After 30 months, if you tell me that I would receive almost a full refund after my warranty had run out... I am still in shock.Now as for the Switch itself... We love it.  It's not a Playstation 4 or Xbo 10000 or something.  But it's a great family system that also is great for when friends and relatives visit.  Recommend the Switch for every household.
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Situation Better than You May Think,"







  
  
    First of all, I wanna say that although Amazon may have some date when they say it will be in stock or some date when they say it’ll be delivered, just know that it may be earlier than anticipated. I ordered mine thinking it wasn’t gonna be here until  around June 4th, so about 3 weeks to a month after I ordered the switch, but fortunately, it came 2 weeks earlier! Apparently, I’m far from the only one who has experienced this, and a number of people have gotten their switch earlier than expected, so don’t look at the date thinking that’s when you’re gonna get it, ‘cause you may just get a nice surprise like a number of customers did. Yes, there are some stock issues with the switch at the moment as well as some production issues, but they are not as bad as they’re made out to be, so if you are thinking about getting the switch, go ahead and pull the trigger! Also, DO NOT BUY FRON SCALPERS. As some other people have mentioned, they will buy a switch and then sell it for a greater price than needed in order to make a profit, and although it may be tempting to buy from them so you can get it sooner, it is so not worth paying the extra money when the situation is actually better than amazon makes it out to be. Don’t do yourself a disservice and fall into the instant gratification trap. Be willing to wait a little bit longer for your switch. YOU’LL BE GLAD YOU DID.

    Grown-up with Nintendo systems since the '80s. It never ceases to amaze me how they continue to grow. From the inventive Wii remote motions to now play on the go. Just wow. Bought the physical copy of the Mario with 64/Sunshine/Galaxie- and have been happily playing every night before bed. My 5-year-old is loving the Mario 3D- It is so cool. We had a bit of a row with the controllers, though. They took some getting used to. Even the buttons that you have to push in order to unlock the small controls to the accessories took time to loosen up. Overall- I am glad I found the counsel at the $299.00 price point. Anything more, I probably wouldn't have bought.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love this game system,"







  
  
    I’ve had this system for close to a year now. It has not given me any issues. It was packed and delivered with care. I love the game options and how easy it is to move from hand held play to playing games on my TV. My sister’s kids enjoy playing games on it and I feel they have game options for all ages. The joy cons come on and off easily but stay in place when you want them to. I do recommend getting a protective screen cover because over time the dock the game system goes into starts to kinda make places on the screen over time. Over all a great investment and good buy

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,This switch is phenomenal well worth the price,"







  
  
    The Mario red and blue edition Nintendo switch was released to celebrate a game launch, which was super Mario 3d world, and it also was released to celebrate the 35rh anniversary of Super Mario Bros. It came with a carrying case which reflects the red and blue of the console, a screen protector, a dock that matches the switch, joy con straps that are blue, with a nice red blue and gold braided strap, the plastic piece that tightens the strap is a nice yellow, and a blue joy con grip.It doesn't include Super Mario 3D World, but the case and screen protector really makes it worth it.The con is the rails are still black and the kickstand isn't red or blue, but the black looks nice in contrast. This console is the HAC-001-01 model, so it has improved battery life.Don't support scalpers unless you feel like you have to, but they're at least not charging as much as the Animal Crossing New Horizons edition.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Beautiful Nintendo Switch!!,"







  
  
    I'm quite pleased with my brand new Switch! I specifically got it because I am a fan of Animal Crossing and was happy I got to snag one on Amazon before they sold out. It works like a normal Switch and I actually sold my old one just to get this beauty. ^_^This Switch is a SPECIAL EDITION and I hope they release more for the people that actually want it! PLEASE AVOID RESELLERS!!!

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Purchased 'used', feels like new.","







  
  
    I've been wanting a switch for a long time, and finally managed to get my hands on one close to MSRP (at $307) during the pandemic. I only have one game on it so far, but to say I'm pleased and impressed so far is a bit of an understatement. It's nice to be able to play on my TV in the living room, and when someone else wants to play their own game or watch Netflix, I can just take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode, but stay in the same room and socialize. I like being able to bring the game into my room and not be forced to play it in the living room if I don't want to deal with all the noise.It's pleasant to hold, with just a bit of weight to it to feel sturdy. The Joycons are nice to the touch, although the sticks are a little too 'smooth' for my liking so I put some grips on. I haven't experienced any drift, yet, but it's only been a few days. They're very satisfying to hold, and even more satisfying to click into place on either the tablet or the included joy-con grip. I haven't tried the straps yet.The screen is lovely, and the speakers are front-facing so it seems louder than other handhelds. It IS a little frustrating to adjust the volume while I have it on the kickstand. The kickstand is a pain to pull out, and isn't sturdy in the slightest.Overall I'm very, very happy with it. I can't wait to get more games on it and play with friends.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent!!!,"







  
  
    Seller got the item to me super fast thru Amazon.  Was no need to do a bunch of updates and downloads requiring hours of boredom before playing as it is with my Xbox. Totally fun in every way plus the older game system downloads available with additional upgrade to the nintendo online, and the games with the old system downloads are awesome. One of my favorite parts of this system. And seamless swapping from TV to handheld device is great. All around an excellent system for any type of gamer wanting to just have fun.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's everything I could've ever dreamed of and more.,"







  
  
    I had experience with the Switch since my family had a shared one for a while, but sometimes you get tired of passing the console around so I got one of my own! I'm so glad I was able to get the New Horizons one because it's so much cuter in person and as an avid Animal Crossing fan since the 2001 Gamecube release here in the west, it's just so good. It took a while since this design is so popular but when I finally caught it during a restock period I knew I had to grab it!I love the color scheme, and seeing Tom Nook with Timmy and Tommy on a lil' island is so precious <3 The all around aesthetic makes it feel like both a console and an artpiece dedicated to your new journey on a deserted island.If you're a big AC fan who can afford to get it and you're able to grab one when they're in stock, I'd say to go for it. Nintendo most certainly knew what they were doing when they made this design because I had wanted this Switch since day one.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,No regrets. I waited and snapped it up when it was in stock again at retail price.,"







  
  
    Finally got my hands on one at the retail price last month (To hell with price gougers.  I don't ever support them. I hope they die of Covid) and I am having a lot of fun with it. I'm usually a pc gamer but I really like that this is portable too. The battery life is nice and the motion controls are alright but I tend not to use them.  I was confused about where to put my micro sd card till I looked it up. It's hidden under the kickstand which is kind of flimsy and the only real con when compared to the list of pros. So far I've got Skyrim, Lego Harry Potter, My Time at Portia, Nine Parchments, and the Deponia games to occupy me for now. I've wanted one of these for a long time and I do not regret my purchase.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exceptional Portable Gaming Experience,"







  
  
    This was my first hand held gaming device and I think it is a very unique, innovating what a portable console should be. I love the portability of it on the go and the ability to allow multiple players play at once. For $300 I think this is a solid gaming console that can be used to pour hundreds of hours into and still find games refreshing. The Nintendo game lineup also has the best exclusives out of the other competitors, from Mario to Zelda to Animal Crossing, there’s a game that suits anyone’s taste. Of course there are improvements to be made such as the joycons being small and sometimes uncomfortable in the even if you put it in together like a controller, it still doesn’t replace the feeling of a real full sized controller. In the future, I would just like Nintendo to make the portable screen 1080p with a 120hz refresh rate for an even better gaming experience. But overall, with its creativity and innovation still standing strong 3 years later, there isn’t much you can’t love about the Nintendo Switch.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Totally worth $299.,"







  
  
    If you’re willing to wait, Amazon occasionally gets some, and puts them up at regular price.  Received mine much sooner than their initial estimate. As for the console... it’s fun, everyone knows that. Great first-party games, and a nice selection of third-party games. Okay battery, unusual but feature-packed controllers, and a tiny bit uncomfortable for extended play in handheld mode. Less powerful than its competitors, but ray tracing does not a good game make.Just do everyone a favor and don’t pay a scalper for the console. That’s the only way to choke them out. Stay patient and check multiple stores, regularly. Eventually you’ll find one at the proper price. You’ll have your dignity, do a service for the community, and definitely get your money’s worth!

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nintendo Switch,"







  
  
    Bought so I could play with the family when I have to travel for work. Bought in used-like new condition from Amazon. Inspected the product as soon as it arrived and found zero issues, didn't even appear to have been used at all. Everything was wrapped as if it was brand new. I also checked to ensure that someone with an older model Switch didn't Switch out their console withe the new one and then returned it. Needless to say, it was not the case and I did receive the new version. So far I have had zero issues, tons of games and hours of play time. Best part, it wasn't over priced in comparison to what is currently being offered by 3rd party sellers.
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, fun gift","







  
  
    My 18 year old son loved this gift he requested.  Especially because it’s been nearly impossible to get the newest X Box without paying much more than the regular selling price because no one has any stock in stores for over a year now.  This was his other option as a gift and he has been very happy!
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,This was a well received gift,"







  
  
    I purchased this as a gift so I can't speak to its features. It was late arriving and I had to actually call Amazon to get it sent again due to some mishap on that end. The family who received it were dismayed to learn they couldn't use it until they purchased a game or games, but I gave them the link to get a membership to Nintendo's online club so they can play online for free. They were overjoyed with both the Switch and the website.
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best price I could find,"







  
  
    Brand new, pretty/unique colors, and best price I could find. This was out of stock both online and in stores at big box stores, and the places that I could find it, the price was $100 more expensive than it was here.You can NOT beat $299 at this point! I love my switch!
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it.,"







  
  
    I don’t know about you but I battled with getting the Switch for ages. I wasn’t too sure if the price of the device was worth it or not but I eventually bit the bullet and bought it and I have no regrets.I like how the device can be hooked up to your tv or you can bring it with you on the go. Right now as I get settled in a new place I’ve been bringing it with me on the go, sometimes I’m on campus and there’s nothing to do or I’m waiting in between classes so I just whip out my Switch and begin to play.It was worth it for me, I am waiting for more games to arrive for the Switch but there is a decent selection of games to choose from.

4,1.0 out of 5 stars,Embarassing Scalpers and a Letdown of a Game,"







  
  
    It's incredibly disappointing to see nothing but overpriced third party sellers are distributing this product, and the fact that I had to sign up on several stock-tracking websites just to have a chance at owning this console is more than disheartening.To top it all off, the game itself feels like a huge downgrade compared to its predecessor, New Leaf. Not only are several quality-of-life improvements missing, but tons of content such as the Dream Suite, Happy Home Showcases, deep sea diving, and more are absent. Why is island-visiting the only option for multiplayer when multiplayer island tours existed in New Leaf? Surely not because of hardware limitations?  Villager dialogue feels empty and simple, devoid of personality aside from their preassigned type. And let's not even start on the One Island Per Switch discourse. Not only was getting ahold of this console an absolute nightmare, but having to pay $60 for a game that feels unfinished is a disgrace. We can only hope that Nintendo has plans to add content (hopefully not behind a paywall) in the future instead of relying on nostalgia to fuel sales.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love My Animal Crossing Switch,"







  
  
    Glad I was able to get this edition of the Nintendo Switch. I wanted to purchase the Animal Crossing Switch earlier in 2020 when it first came out, but it was quickly out of stock. My order arrived in a timely manner and in great condition. I only have 32 GB of memory, but I haven't come across any memory issues yet while playing a few games. I like that this console not only has a cute design and fun colors, but it came in a neat Animal Crossing cardboard box with every item needed for operation neatly organized. I had to buy or download my games separately from this purchase. This does not include the Animal Crossing: New Horizons game as part of the package.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Kids love this!!!!!,"







  
  
    My grandchildren had one switch console and were constantly fighting over who got to play first, so I bought this second one and they just love playing together now.  It charges up quickly and the battery lasts for days.  We took both switches on a vacation and the battery stayed charged until we got home 3 days later.  The games are all age appropriate and keep them entertained for hours.  This is one game system everyone in the house can enjoy.
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seller was great and console works perfectly,"







  
  
    I love my Nintendo switch. Even though it was overpriced, I understand that it is due to low supply due to the pandemic so I am not that upset about it as the console has been working perfectly and came with everything advertised. The only problems I ran into were low memory and short battery life on the device but those were easily fixed. The seller was also very helpful and the switch arrived much earlier than expected and on my birthday, coincidentally. Definitely worth its original price ($299) and even though the rise in price is disappointing and definitely pricey, I would argue that its also somewhat worth it. Playing on this is a good way to spend lockdown, so I don't regret making this purchase.

The Animal Crossing decal on the Switch is really good quality and everything else about it has been great.There's not really much else to say, I mean, it's a Nintendo Switch. It is a really great console with lots of fun games to chose from!

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,So glad I found this Switch on Amazon!,"







  
  
    I had been looking for the Switch for my son sunce earlier this year. Due to Covid it was either constantly sold out or the prices were jacked up. I knew the MSRP and refused to be ripped off. I constantly looked at BestBuy, GameStop, Walmart, Target and others with no success. Both Amazon and EBay were too high priced. I told my son it was doubtful he would get one in time for Christmas and he had accepted that. Then a miracle happened and I found this Amazon seller who sold it for MSRP, plus shipped it quickly so we got it in time for Christmas! Highly recommend! Thank you. It works great too!
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Product from a Trustworthy Seller!!,"







  
  
    I bought this Nintendo Switch from this Seller. It was an Extra $145.00 than the original Retail Price of $300.00, but I believe that was because of the Switch Shortage that happened everywhere due to COVID-19. The actual Product I received was top notch though. It was packaged very well. I didn't have a problem opening it which I have had with some other Products which actually lead to me accidentally damaging those items. But no such problem here. The actual Switch itself was also in perfect condition. No scratches anywhere on any of it. And nothing was missing. It runs perfectly fine too. Nothing wrong with it whatsoever. I am very happy with it. The only downside, like I said, was the Price, but is understandable given the Pandemic and Shortage. So I'm giving this Five Stars. Great job!!

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,AC Fans - this ones for you,"







  
  
    Personally, these joycons are two of my favorite colors. So that’s already amazing. Second, if you’re a big AC fan, this Switch theme is so much more meaningful. Okay, and it’s the same price as the regular switch (well, when you’re able to buy it from a reputable company and not with price gouging). It comes with everything you need - the device, two joycons, charger, dock, and I really want to say mine came with the hdmi cord? I got it about six months ago and have a ton of hdmi cords so I don’t quite remember. It does NOT come with acnh, which is awesome if you previously shared a device.

    Item was in perfect condition when arrived.  Shipped faster then expected.  Four stars do to no manual, rather easy set up even without documents.  I feel I was one of the last buyers at below three hundred dollars.  This is the updated unit with extended battery life.  No visuable damage at all.  Unit runs perfectly, shipping box arrived undamaged, everything package neatly.  Unit appeared to be brand new.  Just decided to give this five stars, I honestly have no issues with item or seller.  Would buy again from seller.

So when we saw it on Amazon, we knew we had to jump on it. So glad we were able to get it finally. She loves the pastel joy cons & the design on the back. The dock is even cuter in person.It was packaged nicely & delivered right on time! Everything that was advertised was in the box & individually wrapped. There weren’t any issues upon opening. The system runs very smoothly! My gf hasn’t had any issues while playing & she’s been playing it almost every day for about 2 months now.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nintendo did it Again!,"







  
  
    Fantastic Console! Nintendo truly knows how to design a solid gaming console from the portability of the Switch and being able to play it on the TV. What I love about the Switch is the games are actually full length instead of the shorter and more casual games on the 3DS.  The games are expensive but the PS4 and Xbox were too when they first came out. The Switch is still a fairly new console and a lot of great ports are coming to it.  I always look out for deals and end up with games for $40. Overall I truly am enjoying the Switch being an owner of a PS4 Pro and Xbox One S.

    The most important thing is that it came and it worked. On a secondary note, I enjoy the green and blue aesthetic as well as the Animal Crossing designs on the back of the main screen. I used this system to play Animal Crossing: New Horizons, Monster Hunter Stories 2, Monster Hunter Rise, and Just Dance 2021. It worked fine with all of them.An important thing to note is: It does not come with the ‘Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ game. The game is not included with this console.

    I now have two of these consoles and, if needed, would buy a third. I love my switch so much. It is by far my favorite console. The ease of switching it from the handheld to the tv is flawless. The battery life on the new consoles is much better than the previous model which is great. I gave my old model to my three-year-old who loves playing this console as much as I do! Every morning, the first thing he says when he wakes up is ""Can I play my game?"" So it really is a great console for all ages! Would buy again and again!!

    I seized the opportunity to get this particular switch at non-scalpy prices! (You know who you are.  Shame)This is a v2 switch and operates like any other.  You just so happen to have the nice color scheme and an adorable image of the nooks printed on the dock.Really this review is more about Nintendo re-releasing plentiful units of this edition amidst many people trying to take advantage of others.  Thank you very much, Nintendo!

    It’s great! Bought this to play Pokémon since I waited 3 years for them to release games I had been waiting on. Sold my original switch, this one is the new model with the longer battery life! And it’s definitely noticeable. I have gone entire days (hour are a time usage)  using it and not had to charge it till I got home or went to bed. One issue that still remains is the onboard WiFi on the console is still just as bad as it was in the first original model.

I love this version as it can be used on the t.v. or in the car.My husband is the techie one, so I am sure he can speak to the games, graphics etc. However, if you can get your hands on one, you won't be disappointed.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good Buy‼️,"







  
  
    I purchased this system for my 3 year old son. It arrived earlier than expected brand new in the box. Although Animal crossing is to advanced for my son, ie. he can’t read the subtitles, I play the game and I love it. ( I’m 41) haha but you won’t be disappointed with the purchase. I also purchased a few other Nintendo switch games and enjoy them as well. One recommendation I would pass on is “not” buying the actual game cartridge but buying the downloadable version as you won’t worry about losing the tiny cartridge as my son did, but we later fixed them, I was upset at the thought of $60 dollars going down the drain as I should have bought the download so I wouldn’t have that issue. Enjoy ☺️

    I travel often for work, so needed something to do in hotels and long flights. The Switch hits the mark. This newer version has great battery life, i never had the old one with the shorter life, but no complaints on this one.I immediately jumped in with the old NES and SNES games you can get by subscribing to the online platform. They look great and play great. Also have been playing Link's Awakening and Super Mario Odyssey, beautiful games and looking forward to more.Seamless switching between big screen and small screen is really impressive.

Great for handheld or playing with others on the big screen. would certainly recommend this to someone who loves playing games either alone, with family, or, if you purchase the online package, with complete strangers.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,An actual product review.,"







  
  
    Here is an actual product review, not an opinion on the sellers business ethics. To start, I bought this solely because it's the limited edition version. It does not come with the animal crossing game however, so keep that in mind. The product is exactly as advertised and was completely new and unused. Absolute perfection. The price is not ideal, but Amazon has amazing financing options. So overall it's a beautiful device and so very cute. I definitely don't regret buying.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Very lucky and love the animal crossing switch,"







  
  
    I love the animal crossing switch! I have been waiting for this product to restock for a long time. On October 13 2020 i got very lucky. I was browsing amazon and i saw the animal crossing switch on nintendo products, i clicked on it and it was at 300$ its msrp price and brand new. I immediately bought the product and have loved it since. It is now February 19 and i keep on forgetting to write a review so now i am. Overall amazing product and recommend to wait it out for the restock. October 13 was a restock day for all switches because any switch i clicked on it was at msrp price.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great,"







  
  
    I had been wanting a switch for a little time now and was glad I came across this. The price is exactly where it should be and the console works perfectly. Have had this product for a couple months now and havent had an issue since.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome quarantine pickup,"







  
  
    I already own a Switch but wanted to pick one up for my fiancee to have fun during quarantine. She is someone who has never played video games and didn't like them on the few occasions I tried to play a multiplayer game with her. Managed to pick up a used one (that looked virtually new) from Amazon Warehouse for about $240, which was a steal. She is really enjoying it and slowly becoming a regular gamer (1-2 hours a day), and the Switch has several games that are great for newcomers. She prefers handheld mode while I almost exclusively play it on my TV, so having that option is awesome.
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great system,"







  
  
    I am a 41 yo mom of 3. We have all the gaming systems (🙄). But I have never been interested in video games until we bought the switch & Zelda Breath of the Wild.  So fun. And I love how easy it is to take places & even to take to friends houses to all play together on the TV. It’s so small - even taking the dock with its not a hassle To take it places unlike when my kids want to being their PS4 or Xbox somewhere.  Anyway. It’s fun. Get it. Don’t be lame.
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing Console,"







  
  
    The switch is honestly the perfect console. Being able to easily transition from a portable console on the go to a docked console connected to your TV is everything I wanted. When I am tired and no longer want to sit at the TV and play, I grab it and jump in bed and just continue. My only issue is quite technical: the resistance of the Joycon controller buttons is too high. Takes too much effort to press them down. I got a pro controller and the difference is astounding. I don't understand why the Joycons don't have ""soft"" buttons like the pro controller does.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great system would recommend,"







  
  
    I love the game and function of the system so much. The dock mode to handheld and vice versa is fantastic. I will say that this system is one of the most fragile consoles in recent memory. I am afraid to use it in handheld in certain situations because if it drops you’ll be very lucky it doesn’t break. I went through a pair of Joy cons already due to this. All in all amazing system just fragile.

    Im a pc gamer but i wanted a portable console to play my rpgs and single player games when im in bed.The convenience of the switch has helped me relax after many stressful sweaty fps, or competitive games i play.I havent owned a nintendo product since the launch of the ds light and im pretty happy with this product and the colorscheme.Im 26 and will never be to old to enjoy my console.
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Animal Crossing Switch is Perfect!,"







  
  
    I love the cute cradle design and the joycon colors are awesome! The console has an Animal Crossing design on the back side but I keep mine in the cradle most of the time. Everything works perfect, lots of games to choose from, and of course the Animal Crossing New Horizons game is the best! I have spent way too many hours playing away on my island. For the amount of time and enjoyment I have gotten out of the Switch it's easily the best purchase I made in 2020.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Family gift was loved by all.,"







  
  
    We gifted this for Christmas to  family of five.  What a surprise to them, and all were very happy.  I like that it is portable and not take up  lots of space and also can play on the TV monitor. It seems well thought out to be versatile.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great but game is not included,"

"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Nice console,"







  
  
    A nice console so far, great price all things considered, it's not as powerful as an xbox or a play station but it kinda gets you entertained, it has a nice library of games and although I'm not used to play on the go it's nice to have the option, the only thing that's really a bummer it's the price of the games, they're really expensive considerig the price of the other two consoles, it's definitely a different console but it's fun and a nice acquisition for a gamer
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,JUST GET IT !! It’s worth it,"







  
  
    Super cute! I saw some reviews that said they felt the quality of the joy cons were bad but I don’t feel like that. Everything feels super sturdy! Everything is here and packaged well. Even came one week earlier than expected. Battery life is way better than the first switch and the switch lites.I definitely recommend getting it but only if it’s at the regular $299 price. Don’t fall for the people selling it for 4-$500!!!
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite purchase ever!,"







  
  
    By far my and my family's favorite gaming system ever! Believe me we've had so many gaming consoles over the years. My 8 year old girl will not put this down! She loves Zelda! We plah Just Dance frequently and it has excellent intelligence to what you are doing. It really gets you moving if you are willing! You can play classic with it hooked up in a dock and connected to the TV (console is very small which is great), or you can put the joy cons on the console and play, of you can play with it looking like a old Nintendo 64 controller or x box/playstation controller. It's also touch screen!
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,This is such an awesome switch!,"







  
  
    This is my first switch, and I was so happy to find any switch back in stock! I saw this special one, and loved it! I love animal crossing! The box, and console are so much more beautiful in person! Powers up great, and was very easy to set up! Tried playing a couple games I have and it works great! A limited edition switch for the same price as the regular one was amazing! I recommend this to everyone!
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super happy with my purchase,"







  
  
    The Animal Crossing is gone and I wanted one. This was the cheapest seller I could find. I was very nervous as the time came closer that my switch was coming.Was super excited when it got here and it was in fact an animal crossing switch.Yeah I paid 80 bucks more then the regular retail price, but every where was sold out and I wanted one before we wouldn’t be able to get them at all.I just wanted to say that it came as described. Animal Crossing switch and in prefect conditions. Unopened box, everyone wrapped in its place and nothing missing.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Whats not to love,"







  
  
    Nintendo fans, newbies, kids, veterans, you name it theres a game on the switch for them. Its a fun system that you can travel with and it works very well in both tv or travel mode. Our family loves all the pokemon and mario games they have. Its a fun console and we are thrilled to have gotten one knowing that they are usually a bit hard to find. This system is a 10 out of 10 for fun for the family
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Delightful console,"







  
  
    Awesome console! I was reading other people’s reviews and realized the battery concerns on the console earlier to this one. And the console I got has pretty solid battery life—I could play until I kind of want a break and without being interrupted by battery low alerts (or perhaps I’m just not that professional a player). But I think for people like me seeking some break from work before getting back to it, the battery life feels decently adequate. Apart from battery, everything else works well too.
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Received much sooner than promised, pricing was the competitive retail price","







  
  
    I bought the Nintendo Switch, so I could spend time with my Grandchildren playing online.  The switch units were out of stock everywhere.  The price, $299.99 on Amazon, was the typical retail price while some places were charging much more if they had stock.  So I decided to place the order on Amazon and when it was available it would ship.  I guess my timing was just right.  I placed the order on a Friday night and the anticipated delivery was originally 3-4 weeks.  I received several updates over the weekend, and the unit was delivered on the following Monday afternoon.  Good price, good delivery, the unit was the latest model and was a new unit not a re-manufactured unit.  Ideal transaction
  
"
8,1.0 out of 5 stars,This is not a limited edition!,"







  
  
    Nintendo will release this special edition in the beginning of April, this is not a limited edition, so do not waste your money! Just wait for several days.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Do NOT GET PRICE GOUGED!,"







  
  
    I absolutely adore the Switch and Nintendo as a whole, I’ve had a dry spell with them recently and buying a Switch changed that.Anyways, as many of you already know, the damper on production ability and rise in demand have seriously affected the availability of this product. BUT you can still get them new, at MSRP, like I did!There are bots that can notify you when there is stock for any specific model, color you’re looking for. I used a Discord called “stock informer” and was able to get a Switch at its actual MSRP within a day.Be careful out there, don’t cave in to the gougers. It’s not worth it. You’ll be spending a lot on games, anyway. So save your money!

    At first I was a bit hesitant due to some of the one star reviews, but I am NOT disappointed.I was upgrading from a switch lite and tv mode is the best thing EVER!Playing NES games on the tv screen reminds me of playing with the wii As a kid. I love it!!Plus I was an animal crossing addict going into this and right now I am 80 hours into the game!If you aren’t sure, but it! You won’t regret it!
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fun, simple gaming experience. No censorship.","







  
  
    I haven't enjoyed a Nintendo console this much since N64.  The mobile feature is pretty cool.  No Netflix and extra stuff.  Eshop is simple.  System processes games quickly.  Worst part is the peripheral devices and other things are expensive.  Games don't deflate much in value, and then people buy up the physical copies.  The eShop will help you get those hard to find games.  Nintendo doesn't censor games either. Very important.!
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Yay switch,"







  
  
    I got both a switch and switch lite. Love them sooo much. If you are up in the air about which to get the lite is FAR SUPERIOR as a handheld device. It has a D pad, it’s significantly lighter and just feels great in your hands. The regular switch obviously can do much more and now has a longer battery life. However it does feel cumbersome as a handheld device compared to the lite, but a nice grip case will help with that. Skull and co makes a great case
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Brand new system in perfect condition,"







  
  
    I didn't realize they're charging $50 more than Gamestop until I looked at other reviews, but since I still had $50 left on a giftcard, I'm not too bothered by it. The console was brand new and works very well. It didn't take more than a week to arrive. At the end of the day, if you want a Switch and there is nowhere real close by that has them in stock, I'd reccomend it. Only thing is I think its asinine for these guys to want to increase the price just based on the color of the controllers... I wanted black, but I wasn't paying extra for that. As for people being floored by the price, I mean, it was your choice to by it.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,KIDS LOVED IT!,"







  
  
    I got this for my 11-year-old daughter for Christmas and she LOVES it. Turns out my 5-year-old and husband enjoy playing on it as well! It's not a nice size screen and it's really cool that you can play it on the go or hook it up and play on the TV. You do need to make a Nintendo account, though, if you don't already have one in order to play on it, but overall set up was easy and didn't take too long. While the system was expensive it was definitely worth the investment! I do suggest getting a case to keep it in to keep it safe when not in use, though.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Flawless Delivery,"







  
  
    It arrived today safe and sound in the original packaging without any tampering or damage. The box is of course placed in a standard Amazon box with extra cushioning, so it is well protected. It is indeed a legitimate Animal Crossing edition switch, and everything works exactly as it should! I'm so glad I waited for this restock rather than buying one from scalpers elsewhere. This edition is even more beautiful in person!

    Me and my family have only just received it and it is awesome.So far, the battery does seem to be lasting a bit longer and for the casual gamer, like me, I'm enjoying it.I was slightly worried that I wouldn't get the updated version, but it wasn't an issue.  I got exactly what I ordered.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Super cute!,"







  
  
    Works perfectly and is super cute. The left joystick is a little finicky but I know that is a running problem with the Switch in general and not something that is the seller's fault. I was so happy to finally be able to find a Switch for the actual amount it is supposed to be, and even better that it was the Animal Crossing one! Thank you so much for not being one of those greedy merchants who have jacked the price of the Switch up $100-$200.
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,You need it in your Life,"







  
  
    With all the choices in consoles today along with the price tag and a descent media library of games one may be indecisive about choosing which to acquire , well the Nintendo Switch is by far the easiest most versatile handheld or docked system there is. Wether your a pc or console gamer the switch seems to be in a class of its own and every enthusiast should have one in there gaming arsenal. Excellent

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Was exactly what it said it was!,"







  
  
    I was really skeptical purchasing this switch off Amazon based off of the reviews, but I went for it and so glad I did! It came brand new, no scratches and in its original packaging. I have been playing on it everyday since I got it with no issues as well. In my opinion, I think the Animal Crossing switch is the safest one to purchase on here since it has the best reviews.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,I LOVE MY SWITCH!,"







  
  
    I’ve had a Nintendo Switch before, but I just replaced it and it came today! No damage was done to the console or any of the accessories inside as I got it out. Feels just as I remember it. I’m sooo excited to be playing Zelda again! The only thing I was unhappy about was that the delivery guy didn’t follow instructions I left to knock and ring doorbell. It was also raining and the step he left the packages on were getting wet. So I spent $320 on this just so it could have potentially gotten ruined if I hadn’t seen the truck or got a notice it had been delivered. Other than that, I love it!!! Highly recommend!!!
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love the Animal Crossing Colors!,"







  
  
    What can I say....its a Nintendo Switch! But the fact it has the Animal Crossing colors is a nice touch. The Switch has worked without issue since its purchase. While it does not see heavy used, it is used most days. I don't regret buying this edition of the Switch at all.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most definitely worth the wait,"







  
  
    I wanted one of these bad bois back in March, I missed preorder and didn’t wanna pay $500 or more. I’m beyond happy that Nintendo decided to release more of these. The console is beautiful in person and was 1000% worth the wait. Snag one of these while you can!

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great console, make sure to buy a microSD!","







  
  
    Got the console when it had been restocked for the standard console price, and I adore it! It is so cute and pretty, and the back of the device has a print with a nice laquered texture. Overall great, only issue would be the lack of storage, which is easily remedied with a microSD card, but for the price it really should have at least included one.

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Hours of Fun!,"







  
  
    I had purchased this from the Amazon Warehouse, the console was listed as used, but don't let that fool you!  The console was in pristine condition, not a single scratch on it.  I love playing on this Switch, whether it is Mario Kart or the older games provided by Nintendo's service.  It is definitely worth getting the barebones but you will need to buy games and memories cards for it especially if you are planning to get digital downloads.

    These came back in stock in the beginning of October, and I was quick to snatch one up for my niece. She absolutely adores it and is happy with it. I originally planned to buy it as a Christmas gift, but didn't want to chance it going out of stock again. This is definingly worth the $300 price tag, but no more. She was also able to easily transfer her data from her Switch Lite, which is now going to her younger sister. If I didn't already own a Switch myself, I would pick this up for the color scheme alone!

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Five Shooting Stars Across the Board,"







  
  
    Notice how people who have verified purchases have only given 5-star reviews (as of this writing on 18 March 2020). This is for a reason.I love this system. It is the most beautiful combination of the Switch backing, Joy-Cons, and dock that Nintendo has ever released for the Switch. The overall design, especially Nook and the Nooklings on the dock, is so cute and the pastel colors for the Joy-Cons, like all other Joy-Con colors, look so much better in person. I'm so happy to be a huge fan of Animal Crossing and receive such a beautiful Switch.Nintendo needs to manufacture a lot more of this Animal Crossing edition Switch and they need to make more themed Switches in the future. If you don't have a Switch and you can get this one at a *reasonable* price, don't hesitate to purchase it.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just buy in a store!!!!,"







  
  
    I dont ever leave reviews but this is something else. The switch came and works everything is there but theres literally a blue line across the entire screen and is so annoying looking at it and seeing it while playing games. After three hours of being told to only return like i finally got one after being sold out for forever, they finally are going to just replace it but still have to wait two months for a replacement cause guess what? Sold out already! Thats better than not getting one at all though. Just glad after talking with 4 people they finally listened to my point of view. Really annoying and frustrating. Never buying electronics online again. Espically not from amazon.Edit: i got a replacement and the screen is actually not broken this time. Would still buy in store because of how hard it was to even get a replacement but i got one so thats all that matters. Console is great when its not broke and it is beautiful.
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,So happy with my purchase,"







  
  
    I can play and explore in games for 7+ hours before needing to connect to the charger. The transition from handheld to tv display is almost seamless (just a slight lag before the display pops up on the tv). I love being able to stay and play at home or take it on the go with me.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, versatile gaming system","







  
  
    This system is awesome! I love that it can be carried around and used as a personal game system or I can pop it into its dock and play on a big screen. It's extremely easy to set up, to use, and to play.I bought the year long Family Subscription to Nintendo Online and each of my kids has their own profile. They can take turns playing alone, or quickly jump in on a shared game. We even got my wife involved once I bought Monopoly from the Nintendo Online Store. I highly recommend the system for any families or anyone who enjoys all levels of gaming

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works Perfectly,"







  
  
    A large majority of the negative reviews are people complaining about the price when this product was being price gouged in 2020, but let me tell you, it’s a perfectly good price now.  System is sleek and easy to set up, making it a very stress-free situation.  Everything is well documented so that you can have the easiest time setting up your console.  Personally, I got the AC switch and it’s absolutely adorable!Only grief I have is that the console came a day early so I have to just let it sit for a day until I get my case, screen protector, and other games. Not the fault of anyone though
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,In Love with the Design,"







  
  
    I am absolutely smitten with the design. Love the white and minimalistic dock, the muted green and blue controllers that are still bright enough to give a pop of color in light. I wish the bezel of the unit was white instead of black to continue the aesthetic, but I love the etched designs on the back regardless. Very easy to set up with my TV by following instructions on the console.

    As I scrambled to get one of these before supplies disappeared, another family member bought one too. I didn't even open it, but the kid got the other one as an early present from an adult family member that wanted her to be able to play games with his son (and him). So who really lacked patience here??? lol

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,My kids loved it!,"







  
  
    The base station is the thing that is Animal Crossing branded. And my daughter LOVED it!  It also was a $1 cheaper than the standard Switch. So, bonus?!!  Besides the pastel green and blue of the joy-con, the Nintendo Switch is your standard device. I bought a second set of joy-cons. So, we have the red, blue, pastel blue, and pastel green joy-cons, which make it fun and unique.

    This is the best item I’ve ever purchased!! It’s super fun to play at home on the tv and at work on my break. The outside with the Nooks is adorable and even the back of the tablet is engraved with animal crossing designs! I’d recommend getting a screen protector to protect it as you will be sliding the screen into the dock and although I haven’t scratched it I would be nervous to.

    I don't have much to say because I'm antiquing the console, missing was being bought up by scalpers and possibly people like myself but I am very happy to have this at the MSRP price point. The switch wasn't sealed but these boxes never are, looks immaculate and would love to have it on my shelf for the next 20 years. I'd argue that the design of this switch dock is better than the new game.

    I've read a lot of comments about being price gouged. I don't feel the same. Honestly it's a rare switch that I have wanted and the extra $100 was definitely worth it. I own it now, brand new in the box. My hands are the only hands that have touched it. It works flawlessly and it really makes me happy seeing the limited edition art work on it. The joy cons don't drift. It is the newer more sought after model and this company got it to me quick! Definitely recommend!

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,What a beautiful console.,"







  
  
    This console is beautiful! I'm not a huge Animal Crossing fan but the new game did catch my eye even more when this Switch was announced. The pastel colors really work on the Switch, along with the design on the back. What really tempted me to buy this specific one was that it is the second version of the Switch. Which of course includes better battery life. I'm sure you've heard this all before, so I won't go any longer. It's a very pretty console and if you have your chance to get your hands on it for the normal market price. I'd suggest that you go for it!

    One of the joycons is a little weird but like, wow!! My little animal crossing machine is working really good to let me keep my mind off this whole quarantine thing!! I've had it for a few weeks now and my friends were wondering if I died.Not many downsides, There's lots of games to play on here since the switch has been out for a while and it doesn't even have to be connected to a tv to let you play. If you know a kid who loves video games but you don't want your 9 year old to get shouted at for being bad at video games by 20-somethings that want to win games after work, this little guy doesn't have voice chat so you don't need to worry.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,excellent,"







  
  
    It was brand new and arrived on time. I do not like the system in general the games are too expensive and you have to pay for a membership in order to purchase these games! you can not play unless you buy the games and they are expensive. You can get about 2 games free for the first timers but that is it. You cant play online unless you own the game.

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Beautiful console, reasonable price.","







  
  
    This system is so beautiful and I got it for not too much more than the actual retail price! On top of it all I received it within days of ordering, picked it up early from the post office and I’ve played it at least once a day since owning it. The fact that it’s the updated version of the Switch with a better battery life means I can play longer on the go, and I don’t think a review of this version of the console would be complete without mentioning the gorgeous Animal Crossing New Horizons designs on the box and dock. The dock is completely white as opposed to the standard black, and features adorable artwork of Tom Nook, Timmy, and Tommy on a deserted island. The joy cons being a pastel green and blue instead of the neon I’ve grown accustomed to with my parent’s Switch is a great contrast. All in all this is a system I’d highly recommend if you love Animal Crossing and definitely something for a collector to pick up along the way! 100% my favorite special edition version of a console!

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfectly Splendid,"







  
  
    I ordered this on March 26th and received it April 3rd! The original delivery date was April 28th, so I was pleasantly surprised! The switch was in perfect condition. Everything was included and packaged perfectly. Thank you to everyone who filled, shipped and delivered my package! My heart is happy.
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,"







  
  
    I’m not much of a video game person, but my boyfriend convinced me to buy the switch. I love it! I see why all the hype haha. Very easy to bring around too. I like how I get to play by myself, play with a group when I have guests over, or play overcook with my boo to get some laughters in.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Fast and easy Refund,"







  
  
    The product was as described.  For the first few days everything was great.  Everything worked and came new and in the proper packaging.  After a few days of using it, one of the controller buttons started failing.  We requested a full refund, and the seller was fast and hustle-free to approve and get return label.  I would buy from them again.
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought for my wife,"







  
  
    I was tired of fighting over the switch so I purchased this to enjoy mine once more.
  
"
1,1.0 out of 5 stars,>$300 is a scam.,"







  
  
    The original MSRP for this console is $300 USD. It’s a beautiful device but it’s not worth any more than the official value Nintendo placed on it. So, if you see listings for more than $300, don’t buy it. It’s more than likely coming from scalpers waiting to benefit off of your desperation. Consumer willpower is the only way to break the cycle these corrupted scam artists have created.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Este producto da lo mas importante en la vida que es ver a los hijos felices.,"







  
    Este Nintendo lo compré para mi hijo, cumplió las expectativas muy buena calidad, todos estamos muy satisfechos y sobre todo mi hijo súper feliz, esa era la intención, de verdad lo recomiendo excelente.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,best thing,"







  
  
    this is my favorite thing that i own. i love being an adult with a job that allows me to make stupid purchases like this that bring infinite joy to my mostly sad life. i can’t believe that i can now play skyrim on my lap. thanks nintendo for giving me something to hold onto. this has added at least three years onto my lifespan.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,No issues,"







  
  
    Came in a neat and new box with no damage or signs of being opened. Handheld came in all the proper packaging and it booted up brand new. Came in the charger and everything it should and we had no issues with it. Only sad thing is it didn’t come with animal crossing on it but it didn’t say it would I personally would have just liked to see that included so no hate for that. My girlfriend loves it and uses it for Dead by Daylight, Pokémon, Hulu and Netflix
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great During Quarantine,"







  
  
    Finally found one used one night at 2am and bought it. Was listed as acceptable condition, but the system and accessories looked like it was in ""Like New"" condition. Been wanting one, but all these price gougers were making it impossible. So far so good. I haven't had any issues that I've seen with the Switch itself. Only thing I have noticed is that there is already joy con drift on the right joy con. Absolutely worth the wait for the right price. Me and the family are really enjoying it during the quarantine.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!!,"







  
  
    I love the versatility of this console. It is lightweight and since I have advanced rheumatoid arthritis that is a real bonus there are thousands of games and the online store gives great sales. Would definitely  recommend the switch as it can be a hand held or a home console either way you want to use it and the price is very reasonable as well.
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love it,"







  
  
    I really wanted a switch. I played with my boyfriends all the time and was waiting for the right time financially to get me my own. I saw this one and love animal crossing. I will say, the joycons are the cutest colors I have seen them in. I love my switch and my dock. I also love the little details on the back
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Everything works as expected!,"







  
  
    I was skeptical, as always, when dealing with an online seller and used products. Absolutely nothing wrong with my unit whatsoever. No physical damage, came with everything as specified on the description, screen works great (no scratches and crystal clear), all of the buttons are crisp and the battery life is what I would presume right out of the package would be.Basically a brand new switch for a used price. Very happy with my purchase, 5/5 stars all day long
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,The scalping is ridiculous,"







  
  
    Good console if you can get it for MSRP, it took me weeks of trying to buy before I was able to get through the checkout process with all the scalpers buying them up within minutes.  Don't pay over MSRP, the shortage is temporary.
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Childhood memories,"







  
  
    The product came early and is a great addition to the house. I have been able to play some older NES games and it has taken me back to my childhood. A online membership and your all set to download the NES system and play away. Even the newer games are good and a joy to play.
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Cute edition and peaceful colors,"







  
  
    Very beautiful and cute edition. Fast delivery. And feel lucky to get one during the 30 minutes' window on release date.
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,You Can Get The Switch For MSRP!,"







  
  
    I ordered the Nintendo Switch for MSRP and I thought it was too good to be true, but I ordered it Thursday and it came Monday! The website I used to help me find stock was stockinformer.com. It alerts you the minute there's Switch stock and you just have to be quick enough to buy it. It may take a few times and a few clicks but I was eventually able to purchase mine and I love this thing! It's really helped me curb boredom. I hope this helps anyone and please don't buy a Switch from any of these 3rd parties jacking up the price.
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,I've been desperate,"







  
  
    With all this quarantine. I should have known to buy this product waaaayyyyy before all of it. But, I've been very desperate into wanting a switch and I finally had the time and money ( yes its outrageously expensive, but it's a definite need if you haven't bought one yet).  Received mine two days after I placed my order, and fell in love the moment I opened the package.  I've always been a BIG fan of Animal Crossing since the Gamecube version come out ( I still play it at times ) and honestly, having this makes me very happy! So, thank you so much for still having this up!!!
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Value!,"







  
  
    Compact and easy to charge, I do not recommend for small children as the controller pieces feel delicate and I'd worry they'd be broken. I highly recommend getting a carry case to protect your device when not in use or charging. Beautiful pastel colors and adorable design based on animal crossing. Suprisingly this was cheaper than the blue and red switch which was great because I like the design of this better.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best game console yet,"







  
  
    Honestly one of my best purchases of the year. It is so portable; you can attach it to your TV or take it on the go in console form. I only have bought one game, Animal Crossing, but I have enjoyed my purchase so much. It is out of stock so often so I recommend setting a stock alert so you don't have to pay for an up-charge.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great system,"







  
  
    Apparently amazon doesn't like when you call them out in a review and won't post it. Delivery sucked. Driver was a pos. 2nd person I talked to on here for help was awesome. System is great. Only paid 299 for it. I wasn't ripped off into paying more. I've been playing this game since day of the very first release. One of my favorite games.
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,A worthwhile purchase with hours of fun for the whole family,"







  
  
    I took a break from gaming consoles before I got this. My last home system was a PS3 and my last handheld was a Nintendo DS. I couldn’t find any games I was really into or anything that seemed worth my time. I got the Switch after having seen my friends using it and after a few minutes of playing Breath of the Wild. Let me tell you.... this system is wonderful!! You’re really getting two systems in one!! Being able to play on the go as well as just plug and play is such a wonderful concept. Not to mention the game options and variety. I’ve played over 70 hours of Breath of the Wild, and loved it. The other indie games available are also great additions. Overall, it’s a great system. Worth every dollar. I haven’t had this much fun with a gaming system in a while. Great job, Nintendo!!!
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my ACNH Nintendo Switch *_*,"







  
  
    We're Aussies living in Germany right now where the Animal Crossing Console ist still sold out so we bought it on Amazon US from Widget One LLC. Just make sure its a genuine company not a private person. We got the console for not more than the classic Nintendo Switch would cost including import fees and tax. We even got some import fees back from Amazon. And what can I say, I'm totally happy with the new Switch. Love the special Joy Cons, the special AC painting on the back and the special Animal Crossing Charging Station. I even got a Message in game from Animas crossing about the new special Joy Cons. The Animal Crossing Switch has the already new battery build in. I totally recommend to buy the switch if you're an Animal Crossing fan and don't have a switch already.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works well and fun to play,"







  
  
    The Nintendo Switch was bought for my son for his 12th birthday. So far its been about 2 weeks give or take and he still loves it. It works well, no issues with the delivery, packaging or the product.He loves playing on it during free times from school, homework and after school activities.
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Condition!,"







  
  
    Product came the first day of the projected arrival timeframe which was an exciting surprise! Packaging was USPS in a sturdy USPS box and taped very well with ""do not break seal"" type packaging tape which I really appreciated. Product came as advertised in Nintendo box, brand new, all main gaming system components and accessories still in plastic wrap and scratch resistant wrap. I'm very very happy with this purchase!! It was purchased as a gift to a family member as a way to help with the stress of all that's going on and I couldn't be happier with my order! Thank you!
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Only one I found for MSRP.,"







  
  
    You can hear the spring inside my left joycon when you move it, other than that, beats expectations. Game selection is huge on the switch, mostly indie developers, but I'm sure there's something for everyone.Wasn't a fan of the pastel colors but DBrand has nice skins for it, I got one that's the ""breakdown"" skin where it looks transparent.
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Awesome,"







  
  
    I absolut3ly love the fact that it's not like the original switch colors. My daughter is extremely jealous because she got the original colors. The only thing I didn't like is that it wasn't made clear how to transfer save data from one console to the other. I thought I had transferred it correctly, but ended up having to start my game over because of this.
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Must have!,"







  
  
    I absolutely love my switch! It's like having every game system in one! I do not regret this purchase one bit. I absolutely love it!!!!! I am 31 with a 2 year old daughter. I have plenty of games I like to play and she does as well. She loves to play Just dance 2021 and it's simple to use and install.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing hybrid console.,"







  
  
    Love the thing, being able to play a lot of these games at home or out and about is definitely a winning situation. I can't compare the battery life to the previous Switch but I haven't had a chance to kill it yet so great job Nintendo.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Easily one of the best systems I've ever owned.,"







  
  
    The switch is easily one of the best systems I've ever owned because of it's versatility.  Nintendo solved the third party game problem for the switch.  There are plenty of affordable third party games to play.  Some major titles like Mario Kart are forever gonna be 60 bucks and only on sale maybe once a year so there is that to consider.  I haven't used it as much on the tv as I have handheld, although docked mode has always been fine every time, it's just there is so much appeal playing games in handheld mode.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Would recommend to a friend,"







  
  
    I love Nintendo switch feels good to play old school games but when my package got delivered today it got delivered in my neighbors house not mines so who ever did it needs to learn how to follow instructions cause is a lot of money to be thrown out like that
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Not the OLED Model but you can’t bet the adorable design.,"







  
  
    Your best bet is probably getting the newer oled model, however this version of the switch is quite adorable. The switch in general is amazing, espicslly if you like both tv and mobile gaming. Dosen’t have every game out there but you’ll certainly be entertained!
  
"
8,1.0 out of 5 stars,Didn’t work,"







  
  
    Sent me a broken system. Has yet to provide a working one almost 3 weeks later.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it and great colors!,"







  
  
    Do I even need to write a review for this I mean honestly who doesn't know that this is amazing. Espercially the animal crossing version which people were hoarding like toilet paper to sell for double or even triple the price that it supposed to be. Well I finally got one for the regular price scalpers!!!! Love it!!! Colors are great
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Fun, portable, and a step up!","







  
  
    I didn't think I'd like the switch after buying one for my son and seeing him play it. He said he liked it and I was still stuck on my WiiU.  However, I'm loving it right now! I love the handheld game that you can take with you if you would like and I love the console that I can play on my big if I'd like a. The only drawback is the little controller holder is quite small said sometimes uncomfortable if you play for extended periods. Other than that, I haven't found a flaw :)
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my switch!,"







  
  
    I got this as a gift for my birthday so that I can upgrade from my switch lite, and I love it! I have a projector instead of a tv in my room and it connects to it perfectly. This was a great purchase (and I recommend animal crossing and mario 3d world if you want some fun and time consuming games!)
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Gift for my husband,"







  
  
    My husband was given a switch, but it broke-so I bought this as a replacement.  Price was reasonable, and it was delivered as promised.  He easily set it up and has been playing his fishing game all day.
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love love love LOVE,"







  
  
    Excuse my mess in the back! I absolutely love my new switch! It came in brand new and everything works just fine! It’s super cute and super fun to play! Setting everything up was easy and I got a few games I’m super excited about! I’m also happy I got the price at 299 and nothing over! So I feel super happy I didn’t over pay for it!
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love it!,"







  
  
    So, I honestly wasn't sure whether I should buy this or not since I've never played an Animal Crossing game before New Horizons. However, it has quickly become my most played game on the switch and it is so awesome to be able to play it on a system that looks this gorgeous. I don't know if this will go back in stock but I would recommend this to any Animal Crossing fans out there. My favorite part is definitely the island etchings on the back!Do not support scalpers!! I bought this system for $300 dollars and scalpers are out there trying to sell it for more than twice of the MSRP! If no one buys from them they will have no choice but to lower the price to a more reasonable level.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great, highly recommend!","







  
  
    Our 4-1/2 year old loves it!!  We knew she was a little young for it but she needed something to fill a little time during the day.  She stays busy doing activities and school type work but she needed some downtime that wasn’t just watching TV.  This is perfect.  Paw Patrol game was perfect for her to start learning how to play video games.  Since then, she has graduated to a Yoshi game that has her problem solving.  She only spends about 30-45 minutes On it a day, total.  We also downloaded some coloring books and puzzle games.  She loves those.  Highly recommend but watch the screen time.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,So glad I bought this,"







  
  
    I love that this thing is bigger than most handheld gaming systems I own. Plus its coloring is something that Is easy to spot in a dimly lit house. I hope the kid I bought it for appreciates it as much as I do.
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth it!,"







  
  
    It’s such a cute pattern and I’m glad I waited long enough for these to be back in stock! I love the design and having the Nook’s watch me play animal crossing is the best. I would definitely get thumb pads to make the Switch extra cute! The device itself hasn’t given me any problems, but I would for sure get an micro-sd for it.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy customer,"







  
  
    You have the catch amazon because the prices change consistently! After checking 3 times a days for a week i finally caught the price at original price! I received mines today. Brand new. Newer model (-01). Very happy! Shipping was first estimated to be in Oct and after a week my switch was shipped out.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,After 1 Month I'm beyond Happy,"







  
  
    Haven't own a Nintendo console since the Wii. I really wanted something I could play bowling, tennis, Mario etc and after finally pulling the trigger I can say 100% I'm in love with the Switch. My wife and I play every single night and it's great to bring on trips. I wish it was easier to travel with and you didn't need the dock and could just use a USB-C to HDMI but other than that even if you're a casual gamer this is a must have.
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,great purchase,"







  
  
    Shipped well, no damage. Kid loves it. Priced normal. Shipping was faster than expected which is awesome. Always better to get something earlier then anticipated rather then later. Plus it was a Christmas gift so plenty of time to wrap it up.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,"ANY NINTENDO SWITCH CONSOLE WILL RESTOCK, PLS DONT GIVE-IN TO THE SCALPERS!","







  
  
    Please ONLY buy from Seller Amazon or any other seller that sell at MSRP price and not over outrageous over +$300 price.  You are getting the same console nothing extra.  Overall this is a very good switch system and i love every min of playing it wherever I go.  This new model can also run extra hours compare with the older model.
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Thanks for the free game Nintendo. Oh wait. Nada.,"







  
  
    Nothing like buying a game system for $300 and not getting a game to play on it. Ball break for a kid who saved up their money for the system and now has to drop $30-$70 per game. Otherwise neat flexible system for gaming.
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Gaming Experience,"







  
  
    I have always played Xbox and PC but decided to go and get the switch. It is perfect as I can use it to kill some small down time and have a fun game night with friends and family connected to a TV. I get more joy playing these games than standard shooter or sports games on other consoles since most of the time I play the switch it is with friends which makes it better.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,This will give you the serotonin to get through your day,"







  
  
    Sooo great! Can be played on your tv to play with friends or you can play as you pace aimlessly. Makes quarantine and life in general better. Do it for you!
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,One of my favorite consoles of all time,"







  
  
    If your on the fence of getting a switch I highly recommend that you go for it. There is a large assortment of games now In their library. If you can find any communities its also pretty fun. Not to mention they have some of the greatest games of all time whether is BOTW or Animal crossing. This is a must have for kids AND Adults as well.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best gift idea ever!,"







  
  
    We bought this switch for our daughter for Christmas. Got it early so we can load it up with some cool games before Christmas morning. We are so excited to see her face when she opens this present! Best gift idea ever!!!

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Special Edition Switch,"







  
  
    Very Impressed with the depth of this special edition, In the past, the previous Special Editions have been cool, But I feel this one surpasses them all, The two-tone Joy-Cons are great, As is the Dock and backplate. The Joycon holder is about the same as other switches, Just a basic black. But Everything else is great!
