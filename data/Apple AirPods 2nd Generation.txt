0,1.0 out of 5 stars,"Stopped working after a week, Apple gave us a hard time about exchanging them","







  
  
    We bought a brand new set of AirPods for $159. After using them for a week, I was listening to them and the right air pod went dead. I figured, maybe I just need to charge them. So when I got home I charged them, and the next day I went to use them again and the right air bud was still dead. So I did some research, tried to reset them, and then I couldn't reconnect them to my phone at all.Once I contacted Apple, they tried to give us the run around. They wanted us to let them fully die, which makes sense, so we did that. Then, when they still didn't work we wanted to exchange the faulty pair for a new set (BECAUSE WE PAID 159 DOLLARS AND ONLY USED THEM FOR A WEEK). Keep in mind, they were taken care of, not dropped, no water damage, they were expensive so they were treated delicately.  Apple wanted a $180 deposit to get a new set, which is MORE THAN WHAT I ORIGINALLY PAID FOR.I decided to contact Amazon, and they suggested contacting Apple, but once I explained what was going, on Amazon offered to make things right and send out a replacement. Never had an issue with Amazon's customer service, but Apple was extremely disappointing. I won't purchase these again.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,This IS the latest model!!,"







  
  
    Many customers are complaining that this is not the latest model. This is false. Apple released two configurations with the second generation AirPods. The first configuration is $160 and comes with the new H1 chip AirPods and a standard case (no LED on exterior). The second is $200 and comes with the wireless case. This product page is for the new gen2 AirPods with standard case, hence $160. You can check the serial number on Apple’s website and it will tell you that this is the latest model.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Todo bien con el producto , pero no tiene funda con carga inalámbrica","







  
    Al parecer lo que pasa es que el título del producto esta mal traducido al español e incluye la frase ""funda de carga inalámbrica"" lo cual no es correcto, ya que al comprarlo es la funda normal que solo tiene carga con cable.Esto se puede comprobar cambiando el idioma de amazon a Ingles y notando que el título del producto cambia y ya no incluye el ""Wireless charging"" que deberia de tener.Lo dejo como un comentario que espero retroalimente y aclare a las personas que piensan comprarlos y ojala que amazon y apple corrijan este error de traducción.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"These have excellent sound quality and great Bass, too. I think the price is well worth it! LOVE EM!","







  
  
    I have tried several “cheaper” imitations of AirPods and they were just ok. I have been waiting to get these and let me tell you, I’m sold. THESE ARE GREAT! As soon as I got them, I had to try them out. First of all, they paired with my iPhone XR, almost instantly. All I had to do was have my phone open and near the AirPods, while they were still in the charging case, open the lid and within seconds they paired! It displays the charge of both the AirPods and the case on your phone, too! Super cool! I selected one of my favorite Classic Rock bands and started jamming. The sound quality was awesome! These have a excellent Bass response, too. These were a outstanding purchase for me. I’m so glad that I patiently waited for the AirPod 2s! I had been reading a lot of expert reviews about them. The original AirPods are good I have heard, but for several improvements these are even better. I definitely recommend them. I’m another satisfied listener and a very happy customer.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,I like them,"







  
  
    I'm not really sure how helpful a review is at this point. Everyone who's going to buy AirPods already knows that they like them or not. Apple is releasing some AirPods with noise cancellation, I think that's the biggest complaint most people have: that they don't feel like they're deafened to the world around them. But everytime someone comes into my office I have to stop the music or take the AirPods completely out of my ears to hear them clearly. The sound quality is decent. I'm no audiophile so to me they sound great. They also are easy to lose, but so are any other tiny cordless in-ear earphones. Just keep track of them and you should be good to go. At first they hurt my ears so I bought some silicone covers with wingtips. They helped the AirPods stay in my ears without moving around and ""softened"" the edges of the earphones. I guess they stretched my ears out or I just got used to wearing them, because now even without the silicone covers they fit and feel just fine. The battery life is pretty good, and popping them back in the case for 10-15 minutes boosts them almost back up to full. So I'll wear them at work and then if I get up to grab a drink or use the bathroom I'll give the AirPods a quick charge and be good to go the rest of the day. At first double-tapping to get them to pause or skip a song was frustrating but there's a tutorial online somewhere that shows you where to tap to get consistent results: just above the neck of the AirPods. They pair immediately with your iPhone and I've never had any connectivity issues or sound quality issues, so I'm very happy with my purchase.

6,1.0 out of 5 stars,right pod stopped working less than week of purchasing,"







  
  
    right pod suddenly stopped working less than a week of purchasing and as well as case connectivity issues. i did not drop it or water damage it, seems to be a manufacturing defect. Apple is replacing it for me, but it will take a week...

7,1.0 out of 5 stars,NOT THE LATEST MODEL - Disgusting product. Spend your money somewhere else!,"







  
  
    THIS IS NOT THE LATEST MODEL. DO NOT BUY THESE IF YOU WANT AIRPODS 2. Also, mine did not work. They never paired and I feel like Amazon is scamming people by selling these as if they were in fact the latest model.Edit: The second pair just came in and they are absolutely disgusting. If anyone at Amazon looked at these and thought it was okay to ship the product in this condition, I would be surprised. Please look at the pictures I attached. I have never been so displeased at a product/company. There's earwax on the headphones, dust and dirt all over the insides, and so on. I reiterate - do NOT buy this product.

8,1.0 out of 5 stars,Don’t buy!,"







  
  
    Do not buy! When they arrived they were in a box with not bubble wrap or anything. They connected to my phone for a few minutes and never connected again. Do not waist your money!!

     I ordered these ""Original Apple AirPods"" for my girlfriend as a birthday present. I was super excited for her, but to my surprise, as soon as the package arrived I saw there was something wrong. Immediately looking at the box (see pictures and video) containing the ""AirPods"" I could tell this was not an original apple product (no apple logo, or serial number). Once I opened the colored box I could confirm that I was right on my assumption.I already contacted Amazon but I live in the Dominican Republic and I know I can't return packages to the US, so I'm stuck with some cheap knock offs, I will never use, which I paid more than 130+ Dollars.All of this is very annoying... I did NOT buy it through a third party seller, specifically because I wanted to avoid this situation. I'm very upset I got ""tricked"" into buying what I thought was an original product (paid in full as an original) sponsored by Amazon.

"
2,4.0 out of 5 stars,100% honest review,"







  
  
    Taking the Apple AirPods at face value, they're a solid headset for the money! If you already have the original, first generation AirPods and just want to upgrade, not a bad option either. The 2nd generation AirPods feature an improved software chip & runs off of BlueTooth 5.0 vs 4.1 (Gen 1). The software chip allows a faster, stronger, and more stable connection with your device(s). This particular item for $139.00 does NOT feature the wireless charging case. This one must be plugged in via USB (cable provided in the box) to an outlet or USB port. The wireless charging case model is $169. Now if you're looking to upgrade to the wireless charging case later on, you can. Apple does sell it separately. If you want the wireless charging option right out of the box, I recommend sending the $169 vs the $139 product here.Sound quality: Straight out of the box, sound is pretty solid. No crackles, static, pops, or any abnormal noises created by the more economic-friendly headsets. You have a lot more adjustability & tuning capabilities if paired on an iOS/Apple device vs using for example paired with an Android OS device. So, ultimately Apple users may or may not get a better sound quality experience.Noise cancellation: AirPods do fit fairly well in the ear without having to be jammed inside your ear canal. Generally they create a snug fit using Apple's ""universal"" earphone design, it is one size fits most not one size fits all. Some users have upgraded or opted to spend the additional funds on a set of AirPods Pro due to the rubber tips for a better/snug fit. I believe only the AirPods Pro currently has an active noise cancellation utilizing two microphones but I would double-check Apple for accurate information. Also, for Android users. The Galaxy buds by Samsung feature active noise cancellation & wireless charging case on every model so you might want to look into that product before making a final purchase.Battery life: For optimal battery life, I highly recommend charging both AirPods inside the case. The case itself is a battery pack with a life. So if one or both AirPods are low on battery, you can toss them in the case and charge them up. Apple I believe rates 5 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 1 hour of talk/listening time and 15 minutes of charging time is equivalent to 2 hours of talk/listening. I'm sure this is accurate when they're brand new but I'm sure like anything, normal ware & tare might diminish that over time.Warranty: Apple provides a 1-year standard manufacturer's warranty on this product. This ONLY covers defects/defaults from the manufacturer. This will NOT cover physical and/or liquid damages to AirPods, case, or charging cable included.AppleCare: It's $29.00 and 2 years and well worth the extra money. You're already spending this kind of money on a headset, may as well have protection. We get it, accidents happen! But protect yourself and get your AirPods repaired/replaced at no additional cost to YOU! There is no additional fees or deductibles involved.AppleCare tips:You don't have to install AppleCare right away. You have 60 days from the original purchase date to contact Apple by providing your AirPods serial number (on outside of the box) and Apple will tell you if you're still eligible.You can renew AppleCare for another 2 years for the same fee of $29.00 provided you want to keep the same product. If you decide to upgrade to the AirPods Pro or whatever the latest model is, you would have to purchase AppleCare for that specific product.You can go into an Apple store location and get live repair/replacement on your AirPods.Using AirPods with Android:Apple has allowed Android and other non-iOS devices to use AirPods since the AirPods pair/connect via BlueTooth.If you're using AirPods on an Android platform such as Samsung or LG for example there's 2 ways to pair the headset to your device. You either turn on BlueTooth on your device, pop both AirPods inside your ear, find ""AirPods"" under available connections, and connect. Or you might have to pair manually using the button on the AirPods case to make available, pair, and connect.FAIR WARNING:You will NOT have access to all features that the AirPods have to offer on an Apple/iOS device. You will be limited on functions you can perform.I was able to find an app on Google play store for $1.99 called ""AirPopUp"". It is a paid application that unlock access to certain/more features of the AirPods similar to what an Apple/iOS device would be granted. Be aware that you will NOT have access nor the ability to have every single feature since you're not on Apple's network. There may be other apps (most likely paid applications) you'd have to find that may unlock more features such as: AirPods battery life percentage, case battery life percentage, programming LEFT & RIGHT AirPods for certain function(s), skipping/pausing/resetting songs, answer/decline/hang up phone calls, find my AirPods, and more.For Samsung users specifically, you might want to look into the Galaxy Buds. They're a little cheaper than AirPods, I believe Amazon has them for $109.99 + $22 3-Year insurance through Assurion that does cover physical/liquid/accidental damage just like AirPods.Galaxy Buds features:Made by SamsungAudio powered by AKGRubber ear bud tipsPair with Samsung device to get the mostWireless charging caseActive noise cancellationComes in multiple colors (black/white/silver/yellow/red & black combo with Star Wars edition Galaxy Note 10+)Includes changing cord and replacement rubber earbud tips.I know if you pair the Galaxy Buds with a Samsung device it will automatically download an application titled ""Galaxy Wearable"". This allows users to check battery life status of the case and each bud, prompts you for software updates, ability to program LEFT & RIGHT earbuds to do certain function(s), answer/decline/hang up phone calls, pause/skip/reset songs.Apple may charge a lot of money for their products on accessories but they never fall short of being a revolutionary, well-designed, reliable product that works as advertised.

5,4.0 out of 5 stars,AirPod 2 vs Jabra Actives,"







  
  
    I have both the AirPods and the Jabra Elite Actives. I like them both but for different reasonsAirPods Pros- light,-comfortable,-Wonderful phone call performance (at both ends)- great charging case-5 hour battery life- open design allows you to hear traffic, conversations, etc (this is a negative in noisy environments)AirPod Cons:- will not stay in without earhooks- Not water/sweat proof.Jabra Pros:- great sound isolation (especially with Comfort tips)- better base than AirPods,- good battery life,-not as obtrusive as the q-tip AirPods-Much better water/sweat protectionJabra Cons:- the absolute worst customer service you will EVER find. Hope you will never have to use it. I had to return two before I got a pair that worked. THANK YOU AMAZON!If I had to buy just one, it would be the AirPods. But, the Jabras are better in the gym or in noisy environments.

     So glad I got these for only $100! Was debating between the Generation 3 AirPods. It’s my first time owning AirPods so I said why not try the gen 2 first since it’s only $100 compared to $180 for the 3’s. And I’m glad I did! These things sound amazing! The tech inside of them are amazing also. The auto pause when you remove them from your ear is dope! The charge is really good! And the connection is REALLY good. Left my phone in my room and went downstairs to do some things and it was still connected playing my music! LOVE THESE THINGS!!! Can’t beat $100 for these.

    They are original! I compared them to the ones that my coworker had bought from apple and they are legit. They were NOT dirty ( I was afraid of that being an issue since I read other reviews complaining about it ) but not my case! They came super quick and  nice and properly sealed. Charger, case and AirPods brand new out of the box. I’m very happy with this purchase. Have been using it 24/7 and the battery life is awesome!!! Can’t be happier

I’m very impressed with the sound these airpods provide, I was worried that I didn’t get the right ones at first because it didn’t have a led light in the front, but later I found out that the led on the outside is only for the wireless charger, I will definitely buy again, I’m very pleased!I also was a little worried because I saw some reviews that others left that they got fakes, but I’m telling you right now you have nothing to worry about, they are 100% real and worth your money.

    This is my first pair of wireless headphones (coming from the lightning pods) and the convenience is literally easier than plugging in a wire for audio. The literal second you take an AirPod out it will be connected to whichever device you choose. The audio quality is amazing! Cranking the knob to the max and the pods handle heavy bass tracks very well in circumference while tying treble to clarity amongst very busy audio. If you have an iWatch with cellular then you literally don’t need your iPhone anymore. Amazing!!!
  
"
2,3.0 out of 5 stars,Can the Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 compete with the Apple AirPods 2 at $40 less?,"







  
  
    Although the 2nd generation AirPods came out in March 2019, improvements are merely incremental. At the $100 price point, can the recently released Anker Soundcore Liberty 2 compete? Read on to learn how the more expensive latest $140 Apple AirPods stack up versus Soundcore Liberty 2 Pro:QUICK SPOILER ANSWER ANKER VS. APPLE AIRPODS:Yes indeed. At $40 less, the Anker boasts equal sounds and noise cancellation not offered by Apple unless upgrading to the $250 Pro model. The Apple AirPod 2 is the perennial best seller in this price range. You won’t be disappointed unless you need the awesome feature of noise cancellation. The $100 Anker is very well spent and does includes noise cancellation and an equalizer to balance the sound to your taste.SOUND QUALITYI specialize in tech reviews and place the far highest priority on listening quality. If it’s better mic quality you are after, or have hearing difficulty, the AirPods are a bit better, capturing more-subtle voice tones. But for music, the Anker equals Apple’s impressive sound. Once you nail the fit, both will impress all but audiophiles in all aspects of sound quality: accuracy, tonal range, non-fatiguing, and punchy (but not annoying) bass.Speaking of bass, Anker does punch it up. The highs are slightly rounded off, the midrange is fairly flat, and the low end is boosted.NOISE CANCELLATION: Apple vs. AnkerThis Apple model has none unless you spring for the newest $250 Pro version. For a lower price, the Anker’s have it, and do a worthy job. This feature alone lets Anker win the race vs. the lastest Apple AirPod. If you haven’t experienced noise cancellation in headphones, or earbuds, you’ll likely be as blown away as I was. I got my first noise cancelation Bose headphones six years ago when they were the only game in town. Life changing, truly. A must for any noisy environment and a godsend for rest on long airplane trips.The Anker’s were my second noise cancelling earbuds, and while not spectacular like the class leading $250 Sony’s, the result is satisfying. I urge you to audition this feature. When making, phone calls, you may prefer it off.CONTROLLING THE SOUND: APPLE VS. THE ANKER EQUALIZER APP:With the Apple AirPods, open Settings, Tap Music, and then EQ under the Playback tab. Although the Soundcore Liberty 2 boosts the bass, some of us prefer a more nuanced and balanced sound. With either of the new Anker’s the app is a terrific add on. You can get the sound balanced to your tastes easily.ADDITIONAL EARBUD REVIEWS COMPARISONS:If tempted to spend another $100 for the Apple AirPods Pro, have a look at my detailed review of the awesome Sony’s compared with the Apple AirPod:https://www.amazon.com/gp/customer-reviews/R3CQKVFI571CDE/ref=cm_cr_getr_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B07T81554HSHOULD YOU SPEND MORE? VALUE AND OVERALL BEST CHOICE:Although only released in December 2016, the “age” of the AirPod technology is showing. If you can spend more, in late 2019 Apple released it’s latest Airpods Pro. At nearly double the price these hit a “whole ‘nuther level” for Apple to compare closely with the extraordinary high end Sony WF-1000XM3 at a similar $250+ price.If you can spend $200+ Sony the new Sheriff in town and in my opinion beats even the newest $250 Apple AirPods. However, at $100, the Anker’s impress and are better than the basic Apple AirPods with one great advantage: noise cancellation. If you don’t like the black color, go with the sleek and now classic $150 Apple model.Thanks for slogging through this long review. Hope it has helped your important buying decision.NOW TIME TO RELAX AND KICK UP THE JAMS!

3,3.0 out of 5 stars,DID NOT COME WITH THE NEWEST CHARGING CASE!!,"







  
  
    I was spectacle at first buying these online and not at an Apple store, but they are the newest model of airpods. Unfortunately, the charging case that came with it, is actually the case that comes with the original airpods. The new case has the LED on the outside, not on the inside and the Bluetooth pairing button on the back, is supposed to be in the middle of the case, not any lower. These are the new airpods, however, it came with the old case for the original airpods.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Held out for too long!,"







  
  
    I have been an anti-Apple/Android advocate for as many years as I can remember - Until Now. After lots of opinions from friends and colleagues I decided to take the plunge and spend some of my hard earned cash on ""the fruit's"" hottest new product - enter Airpods. These things are AWESOME! The technology in the small package is just mind blowing. I run/exercise every morning and work from home so I can use these in every aspect of my daily lift and they never seem to run out of juice! Some have stated sound quality is not up to ""X"" product but seriously?! Considering what features are packaged into these little pods I would argue they are better than anything you compare against them and they do it at a fraction of the cost! Audiophiles might stick their nose in the air but these things deliver great sound! You can compare them to a litany of Bluetooth wireless headphones which may be better in a certain aspect, but all of the other options give up features that these contain. My one complaint/recommendation for those that are worried about fitment or rigorous movement is to snag some of the Earbuddyz skins. They dramatically helped keep these things planted while I am running each morning and also add a little bit more noise cancellation. A+ Apple....Well done!

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are just amazing!!!,"







  
  
    These are the best pair of wireless earphones I ever came across, apple has definitely done it again. Being an apple fan, I love these! They are so easy to connect! Once I connected them to my iPhone, they were seamlessly connected to my other apple devices. All I have to do is select them in the list from the device you need them to connect and you are good to go. Another good thing is turning them on/off is easy, just remove them from the charging case and they turn on and put them back to turn them off, its simple. And like most of the earphones out there, they connect to the last device you used them with, but its easy to switch device.You have the flexibility to just use one piece, if you like and sometimes it does come handy. Another function I like is the automatic ear detection, just remove a piece from you ear and playback will pause and resume once you put it back, this does help when someone drops by for a conversation and you don't need to actually pickup your phone to pause the playback.The battery life is definitely impressive, I need to charge the case every 2 days. And it's easy to carry everywhere, it being so small.Now the sound quality is crisp and connection is smooth, I found that the 2nd gen AirPods are actually better and improved on 1st gen, but its not worth to upgrade, but if you are planning to get your first one, I would definitely say go for the 2nd gen AirPods, I got a pretty sweet deal on amazon and am very happy with my purchase.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love my new AirPods!,"







  
  
    I love my new AirPods! I was told my order would take two weeks to get to me but amazon prime is awesome and I received them within 4 days! The AirPods are the real deal. I saw some reviews about knockoffs being sent, not sure what that was about but my order was correct. They were insanely simple to connect to my phone and then I was able to have them connected to my other devices as well. The battery life is perfect too. I especially like how placing them back into the case charges them when not using them. You don’t have to actually have the case plugged into the wall to charge them.
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,not worth the hype,"







  
  
    these do not live up to the hype. the airpods do not fit in my ears, they don’t have any sort of noise canceling, and the most i’ve gotten out of two pairs is three months of regular use. the first pair only lasted a month. i sent them back under warranty and they sent me a new pair. and yesterday ( May 9) the right airpod blew out. these lasted only three months. i’ve had a pair of beats solo 2 for almost three years. these are also technically an apple product and i am disappointed in the amount of time that these expensive listening devices last. i refuse to believe that this is a coincidence because i have had two identical pairs and both resulted in the same outcome.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why you should upgrade from the original Airpods or buy new,"







  
  
    The Good:-Much faster connection and switching between devices than original Airpods-Longer battery life-Can say “Hey Siri” versus double tapping on the original Airpods-Stylish-Great sound and microphone works well-Fits well in ear-Incredibly easy to use and pair-Charging case Charges Airpods quickly and reliably-Can track last location of Airpods with Find iPhoneThe Bad:-A bit expensive but Airpods work the bets with iOS devicesThe Bottom Line:I own both the original and latest model of the Airpods and I think it is worth upgrading from the original Airpods. The new H1 chip is SO much faster for connecting to your device and switching between devices. I use these all the time and the speed of connecting to devices and the longer battery life are worth it to me. I also like being able to say “Hey Siri” on the latest model Airpods versus double tapping on the original models. Most everything else hasn’t changed as the look is the same and the charging case is the same. I did not get the wireless charging case as I thought it was a bit expensive. The sound is still fantastic and the microphone works great (I use these to talk to clients a lot during the day). I like the look of the Airpods compared to some of the other options out there (the Bose ones stick out of your ears pretty far which to me seems strange). Overall, I would recommend either purchasing these latest Airpods if you have an Apple device or upgrading from the original Airpods (for the speed of connecting to your devices alone)!***Update as of June 9, 2019My Airpod 2nd generation are still going strong and would still highly recommend!

2,1.0 out of 5 stars,Waste of Money!,"







  
  
    This is a waste of money! After having the AirPods for 1 week the left side decided to stop working. I contacted support and was told I have to pay $69 to get just the left AirPod replaced. Seeming as I just spent $150 to buy them in the first place you can imagine my frustration. Don’t waste your money on these cheap no good AirPods

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I can clear things up for you-the listing is a lie, but I’m happy with the purchase.","







  
  
    There seems to be a lot of confusion about how the seller is offering these for this price and whether or not these are first generation or second generation.  I believe I can help to quickly/easily clear up some of the confusion. These are indeed genuine Apple products. They arrived sealed in the box, they appear to be in brand new condition, the serial numbers match/check out, and I am pleased with what I received for the price.  That said, these are in fact second generation (newest version of this older style) EARBUDS... but the CASE is in fact the *first generation*, or, the older version of this style of earbuds.  That means no light on the front of the case, and no wireless charging.  I do not wirelessly charge my earbuds, I use a cord so it does not bother me. This does come with the Apple lightning cable to charge them.  All of these things aside, the ad itself claims that the case itself is a 2nd generation as well, which is a straight up lie.  So for this reason, I had initially left a 3 out of 5 star review, until I was at Costco today (2/2/2020) and saw the *exact* same thing... gen 2 AirPods, sold as gen 2 AirPods, in a gen 1 case....no light, no wireless charging, comes with a charging cord, for the exact same price.. hell maybe this seller *is* Costco... either way, I changed my review to 5 stars so I could sleep at night. Thanks seller!

    These earbuds have been fantastic so far. People criticize the price, but I’m sorry, there is a reason for it. I never tried the previous version, but these ones connect to my iPhone, iPad, and bluetooth transceiver almost instantly. They are very comfortable and stay in my ears with no issues. I’ve tried cheaper bluetooth earbuds, in the 50$ range, and the difference was night and day. I would pay the extra 100$ on these every day for the increase of build quality and performance.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,These really made me wish I hadn't wasted time and money with other brands,"







  
  
    THE SHORT REVIEW -If you are in the Apple universe, get these.Don't bother wasting your time and money getting non-Apple pods. I already did that for you.THE LONGER REVIEW -I've had three other brands - two of them, very reputable ones - and had issues with all of them, ranging from connectivity to sound quality. The biggest issue was with phone calls which sounded fine to me, but, judging from the complaints, not so much for those on the other end of the calls.Soooo, I finally bit the bullet on Prime Day and got real AirPods. The minute I put them in, I could see and hear that there was no comparison.WHY ARE THESE SO MUCH BETTER?— The sound quality is noticeably superior and connectivity is a dream.— The battery life is great and you can see how much power each pod has.— The case is the charger and it holds a charge for a very long time after it is unplugged. You can pop the AirPods into it and they recharge without having to be connected to anything.— You can use Apple's ""Find My..."" app to locate them if you misplace them. The Find My app locates the case, not the pods, so I now keep the case in my pocket or purse when wearing the pods. That way, when I take them out, I can put them in the case so that when I put the case down, it can be found wherever I've left it.— You can choose to have Siri announce incoming calls and ask whether or not you want to answer each one. Every time I get a call, I think about how much I love that feature.— Siri also reads to you the Messages that you get while wearing the pods.— Using AirPods is generally intuitive, but do read the instructions to know what and how to tap to activate different functions.One little glitch is that, sometimes when I'm listening to music through the AirPods, I'll say something to my husband and Siri will think I'm talking to her and butt in. It's a little annoying, but anyone who has a device with an ""assistant"" knows that that is part of the deal.I got this version because my son has had them since they debuted and loves them. I saw no reason to pay more for features I probably wouldn't use. I love them... and I mean LOVE them.I cannot say how they work with non-Apple products because I only have Apple.THE BOTTOM LINE:As I stated at the beginning of this review, get these. They have been worth every penny.Don't waste your time and money getting non-Apple pods. I already did that for you.

    Right bud stop working after two months with normal use and no damage. Tried different way to reset the device still cannot make it work. Contacted with amazon custom service, first get transfer to apple custom service, being told that need to pay $75 to repair, later amazon customer service helped to fully refund.Did a little bit research online, the quality control for airpods 2 is very bad.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,These are not fake,"







  
  
    I recently had bought these airpods. After buying I had checked the reviews, a lot of reviews said they were fake. In the comments it was very controversial whether they were fake or not. Some believed they were and others believe they weren't. You can check to see if they are real if you go to checkcoverage.apple.com this is a site runned by apple. The site is used for you to fill in your serial number (which can be found on one of the thinner sides of the box on a sticker. You type in your serial number and it will tell you what generation you have and whether it is a valid and real. Mine came up as real and also showed my 2 year apple care warranty too. I believe many people thought it was fake because when you first connect them it's name comes up as ""Me's Airpods,"" However, you can change the name. People probably also typed in the wrong serial number, the serial number validation site is very key sensitive. Many sites say the serial number is the model number which is incorrect. The serial number is extremely long and complicated, whereas the model type is shorter and less complicated. If you look at the top of this product you can see the store selling these airpods are called ""Apple store"" If this was a fake apple site amazon would have said or shut the site down already. Amazon knows when shops are fake or claim to be something they aren't. Amazon would have been sued by now if these were actually fake. Another way to know if your airpods are fake is to check if you can find them on Find My Iphone. If your airpods are connected to phone and you have everything set up it should pop up. If they were fake they wouldn't show. However, you have to make sure your airpods are connected to your phone and everything is set up so you airpods can be found on find my iphone.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Most solid Bluetooth connection you’ll find,"







  
  
    I originally never thought I’d own these..  I have several Apple products and try to buy other brands just so I don’t come across an an Apple fanatic (I'm actually somewhat critical of them)..  I also always want to know if the grass is greener, I want to own the best gadgets regardless of who makes them :)  I own Bose Soundsport free and a couple pairs of Zolo liberty plus.  I also have used an Anker set with the wire between the buds.The AirPods, while I have experienced bugs over the years..  they are the most robust Bluetooth connection I’ve used.  They literally NEVER cut out when using under normal conditions.  I bought the first generation ones because I like that they are small and white, fits perfectly under a hair net that I have to wear in clean rooms for work.  Can listen to my tunes and most people won’t even notice I’m wearing em.  I have put dozens of yards of space between me and my phone, several tall metal machines that one would think should interfere with the connection.  It amazes me how solid they are.Now, I won’t use these for working out as I sweat quite a bit and I’m certain they’ll fall right out.  I think the Bose ones are the most secure for working out.Battery life is pretty good when they are new.  After a year or two you will notice that it declines (based on my experience with the gen1 version).  The battery case could definitely have more juice.  When compared to the amount of charges you can get with the Zolo’s, puts the AirPods and the Bose to shame.People like to complain about the sound quality and sometimes about the lack of noise cancellation.  But I find that they sound really good, granted I’m not really a sound snob..  easy to please..  IMO neither the Bose or the Zolo sound any better.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Improved Over 1st Gen (FOR SURE),"







  
  
    Regardless of what some are saying there is a few improvements between 1st and 2nd gen.In the second gen, Apple uses a H1 chip which  helps with stabilizing connecting issues which 1st gen users experienced. It's also much faster at connecting to your phone and switching between devices. The 1 gen were terribly slower.Secondly, there's the siri function. Not much more to compare about. 1st gen didn't have this function.Battery life. Is the same, cannot tell the difference.Overall great headphones. Not really worth the upgrade if you recently purchased the 1st gens but, if you didn't definitely worth it.

    Good headphones if you Primarily work with apple products. Not a lot to offer if you are Android user. I have bought this for my work phone - doesn't last 5 hours even when listening to at less than 50% volume.  Case has enough juice to charge this 2-3 times. Quick Charging is good. I put in case for 15-20mins and I am good for next 3-4 hours.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,(7/13/22 Update) Too expensive for how long they lasted,"







  
  
    These are noise cancelling.  I didn’t buy these thinking they were either.  I’ve held off for this long not grabbing a set of wireless AirPods because the prices were OUTRAGEOUS!These ended up costing me $100, and I was skeptical at first.  I heard mixed reviews and I wanted to try them myself to see if they were for me.I love them.  The tapping feature helps me a lot since I’m always working in a clean room and if someone needs to speak to me tapping on them is a key component to conversing without having to constantly find my phone to pause what I’m listening too.Their ability to stay connected to my phone through Bluetooth is astounding.  I can walk about 60ft away from my phone and still have clear sound through a closed door.  It blew my mind.I was concerned about them falling out, but now that’s a thing of the past.  They fit well and are so comfortable that sometimes I forget I have them in.  I almost stepped into the shower with them on! That’s how comfortable they are.Hate to say it but even though their prices are pretty high, they’re so well worth it!Update 7/13/22I really loved these, but they ended up getting clogged with earwax (as disgusting as that sounds) and I’m a hygiene freak.  Couldn’t clean the sound ports out and It came to the point that I couldn’t hear much out of them anymore.  I was very upset. (There goes a hundred dollars down the drain in just a few short months)Anyway, now I use TOZO NC9’s, total noise cancellation and they fit better, wireless charging, and are cheaper than these!!  They really blew me away, and I promise you won’t be disappointed.BUY TOZO NC9’s!!

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Bought these for Android,"







  
  
    I bought these to use with my Samsung and they work great.To connect with android, turn on Bluetooth, open the lid and press the tiny button on the back (you'll see a blinking white light) until they connect. It's a bit tricky to connect sometimes as they will turn off when I first try to connect but it's not a big deal because once they do, they won't disconnect again.They're very comfortable and don't fall out of my ears. I don't have to constantly push them back into place. Sound is also great and the bass is on point. They come with a charging cable but no adapter, though I just use the one that came with my Android. There are apps to keep track of battery but I don't use them. The Airpods will make a specific sound to notify me that it's time to charge.If you have an Android and want Airpods, buy them. You won't get all the features iPhone's get but it's totally worth it.

6,4.0 out of 5 stars,Buyer Beware of Old Charging Case,"







  
  
    I am not an Apple fanatic, but I have been using their devices since ios 3G. I do not “jump” at any product they sell, nor do I live for the next upgrade... heck, if it were up to Apple we would all give them our old devices and buy their next big thingy every 1.5 years. Having said that, I waited to get the AirPod 2 and was exited to see an Amazon “sale” of the “latest model”, that is until I received them and found that only the pods are the latest model... the charging case is the old case with the battery indicator light on the inside of the case. This detail could have easily been provided in the description of the item for the consumer to determine if that would be a deal breaker... but nope, buyer beware!!The air pods fit perfectly for me, and the sound is rich & full, so once my music starts playing I get over the fact that I was hood winked by seller!! The transaction was excellent with the exception of the non disclosure of the old charging case.

    Storytime: this past winter while riding our quad through our back yard and around our property, I somehow dropped my white iPods out of my snowsuit into the WHITE snow! It was about two foot deep in the low spots and the plow had mountains of it everywhere else over our heads. Needless to say, my efforts to find them were unsuccessful and I was in tears because I literally wore them all the time ( obviously if I felt the need to even take them outside with me then I wore my iPods excessively) and to me it was not logical to spend that much money on earbuds. It was quite literally a splurge on myself that was not normally something I would ever do. So realizing they were gone when I used them daily reminded me how boring my life was before them. With them I was able to multitask and get my mundane daily chores, work tasks and also play mom and wife all while escaping into an audible book that made time pass so much more enjoyably. I know this may sound minuscule to some but when your life is the same day after day after day, they really did save me from some depressive moments by allowing me to be productive but also do something I enjoy, AND THEY WERE GONE WITH THE BLIZZARD! I cursed myself out and damned myself to the depths of hell for the rest of the day and even with all the heat I put myself under, the snow still stood strong when I awoke the next day and every day after that for the next 2 1/2 months. Eventually I forgot, kind of. I should say I moved on, lol.Then one day came the 3rd week in March and my oldest daughter came to visit me. Are you guessing what I’m going to tell you? Yeah! You’re right! There in my thawed spring ready driveway sat a lonely case with two iPods inside. And that isn’t the best part! They still had a 3/4 charge and both work perfectly to this day, 4 months later.So, my point to those who made it this far? (Nobody made it this far.) Buy them!! You do not need a fancy wireless charging case or the fancy $200 plus dollar newer iPods with the noise cancellation. These are not built to withstand Michigan winters, yet they do. Crazy but so amazing and funny.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Don't bother buying a cheaper alternative,"







  
  
    As someone who doesn't like splurging on things, I'm glad I bought these AirPods. I spent weeks ordering about 2 or 3 different, cheaper wireless airbuds, (one of which I just gave away because the return cost was like $10 bucks) but I should've just went with the Apple AirPods to begin with.I tested them by joining my friends on Discord and having them hear me. They said they could hear me clearly and the background noise wasn't noise at all. Whereas when I tested the other airbuds before, they would say I sounded muffled and breaking up.I almost never have an issue with them falling out of my ears when I take my dog for a walk, but I don't know about running with them. I would probably prefer the AirPod Pros (but then again, not willing to upgrade if I don't need to). The battery on them is great. It can last hours depending on if you're talking on the phone or if you're listening to music and can last SEVERAL hours if you just continuously switch the AirPods from using left to right. I've used them every day for the past 7 months and (even though I've dropped them a few times from 5 feet high) they work just as well as when I first got them.

Honestly I think It’s pretty funny and don’t really care but my only concern is I hope I didn’t pay full price and get used pods that someone else already named “Sugar Tits” lol.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Basically Waterproof (According to I) !,"







  
  
    One day, I was at the poolside listening to music with these AirPods. It was 80°, not a single cloud in the sky. I enjoyed the heat, but decided to jump into the pool to cool off. As I’m completely submerged in water, I realized my music was still playing in my ears… underwater. Of course, the longer I stayed under water, I realized that the audio was cutting out. So then I frantically get them out onto the side of the pool away from the water. I dried it off with a towel, and let it sit for a little bit. Then, I got onto my golf cart to go back home and popped my AirPods back in. Both AirPods survived the water. I lived happily ever after.Thanks

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Consistency & Ease of Use are the best with Airpods..like it or not.,"







  
  
    I'm not honestly a fan of Apple & the way they force some of their ideas on us, but in some cases, they're just unbeatable. When you compare AirPods to every other product out there, nothing is easier to pair, works better or longer and more consistently than these. I don't care about wireless charging myself, but having Bluetooth 5.0 is a worthwhile improvement over the 1st gen for both range and power usage. For what it's worth, I don't think the sound quality is great for music, but they're just fine for conversations.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,A skeptic converted!,"







  
  
    Okay, so I bought these after my third pair of cheaper wireless headphones broke. I was getting tired of ones that attached and had the cord that went around my neck. Hence, I decided to search the internet for the best headphones that would work for listening to music/audio books while working out or doing things around the house. I finally decided to try out the AirPods since they had such great reviews, and because they were on sale. When I received the AirPods, I was surprised at how well they actually fit in my ears. I had worried about them falling out, and though they have fallen out a few times due to my children rough housing and landing on my head, they have worked great for walking around the house and exercising. The sound quality is really amazing, and I am pleasantly surprised at how quickly they charge. I will update this once I've had them longer than a few weeks, but I am extremely impressed with them so far. I was extremely skeptical at first, but I'm very glad I decided to get them!

    I just love my Apple AirPods!  This is the second set I’ve owned. My first set survived one falling into the dishwater (it still worked!), one falling into the toilet (I know—eww! But after fishing it out of a clean toilet with clean water and being disinfected—yes, it still worked!) and one falling into a 425* oven—well, no that one did not survive. Before I could decide if I wanted to risk third degree burns by attempting to rescue my precious AirPod, it slid down under the bottom plate of the oven and burst into flames within seconds. So, here I am buying my second set, and for a great price. I am not a snob when it comes to sound quality (I had a $39 cheap knockoff that I was perfectly happy with, and I still use my wired ear buds from time to time) but after my husband bought me my first set of AirPods I realized how superior the sound is. Easy to pair up with Bluetooth devices and I have no problem wearing them for hours at a time. My biggest problem is—you guessed it, they fall out sometimes—at the worst moments!  Hubby’s told me he won’t buy me anymore if I have another “accident”, but we’ll see...

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the Money,"







  
  
    I didn't know if these were worth the money considering that these seemed like glorified regular earbuds. I actually like these better. While the price is high, it seems worth it in my couple months of owning them. I got these for my first semester at college to ignore people and listen to bomb ass music without looking too broke. FIrst off, these are pretty good with noise canceling. I can hear people sometimes if the music is low enough, but the sound is more muffled. It is great when I want to pay attention to my work or ignore people as they tune out people and they also make it a universal sign of ""don't talk to me"" which is great when I don't want to talk to others in public. Even if I'm not listening to music! The other great thing is the fact that it's quick to charge and the battery life is pretty good!In comparison to regular earbuds or even headphones is the fact that they are easy to pack and easy to access. Headphones are bulky and generally awkward (for me at least) to have around the neck. However, airpods are really easy to put in and then when you are done using them, you put them back in the small compact case. Another is the lack of wire. I don't know about you, but for me the lack of wire is much easier. When I am in the mood to listen to something with my earbuds, I no longer need to un-knot the earbuds but simply take them out of the case. So like I said, I really like these and enjoy the easy access and the small compactness of this as well as the increase in sound quality and battery life. If I could rate this out of 10, I would give it an honest 10.

    Oh my gosh there was a short sale and my Hubby got these for me for Mother's Day and I could not be happier!!!!Pros:* NO WIRES (until you need to charge the case itself)* These are the only in-ear headphones I can use, everything else gives me headaches after a short while.* They fit snug and very rarely fall out.* Charges last half a day of continuous listening to music* Sound clarity is very good!  Callers can hear me better than from my phone by itself because of the case, and much better than my car's mic.* Recharging is very short, less than 15 minutes to fully charge inside it's case - less than an hour and the case is good to recharge the ear pieces for a 2 day period without a wall socket.* LightweightCons:* White shows EVERYTHING!  Every spec of dust, every fragment of ear wax will show up from space!* The charge on the ear pieces only seems to last 5-6 hours at most, maybe only 4 with non-stop listening at a higher volume* Sometimes the ear pieces lose battery and die even while not connected to anything, if not in their case.* Sometimes one earbud seems to lose charge before the other and I still am not sure why?  Stereo sound?* These do not cancel sound very well - I don't believe that is part of the design anyway, but worth mentioning that if you are trying to drown out noisy, gossiping co-workers, airplane humming, or highway tire rumbling, you'll want OVER EAR headphones.

    I waited a long, long time before buying “Apple” ear pods. I have used Skull Candy, Soundpeats, and a host of others. They all have their little quirks and variations. The Apple ones do as well, but not nearly as many. Overall, the quality of these is awesome. The sound is great, it allows for pass through sound so I can listen to music and still hear what’s going on around me, and the charge lasts for several hours.The downside(s). First, my ears don’t necessarily fit these (or the wired ones that always came with the iPhones), so I have to adjust and push these in every once in a while. I know that’s why they came out with the pro ones with the plastic ear bud. Those will be the next pair I get. Secondly, live listen works great, with one caveat. I would have imagined that the mic used would have been the mics on the ear buds themselves. Nope. It uses your phone mic. So, if you put your phone in your pocket and have live listen on, you hear the phone shuffling around in your pocket. In other words, you have to leave your phone out (laying on your desk, holding it in your hand, etc.) in order to use it with any success. Maybe that changes on other models, but for these, it makes the live listen almost pointless. I want to be hands free, with my phone in my pocket, but be able to hear someone if they talk to me. Not sure what else the concept would have been used for in using the phone mic.Other than those issues, I really have no complaints. The case charges the pods quickly and multiple times, so you can continue to use them for a long time. Again, sound quality is as good, if not better, than any other ear buds I’ve used. You can set what the functions are, so tapping the right ear twice can mean whatever you want versus tapping the left ear twice.I am really pleased with these and would recommend them.

    The title of this review kind of says it all--these AirPods are amazing for everyday things like phone calls, listening to music while travelling, and other low-impact activities. The sound is really great, linking them to my iPhone was super easy, and the battery life is really good. If you're looking to ditch the corded headphones and you're someone on the go, this is a fantastic purchase.All that said, I originally bought them because I was looking to hit the gym pretty darn hard to get rid of some of my Covid padding. When I work out, I get really sweaty (ya girl is working HARD), so I find that halfway through my workout, they don't always stay in my ears very well. I make it work, but there are some points where the ear piece feels like it's going to come flying out of my ear if I don't stop and adjust.I'm still going to give these 5 stars because they are pretty awesome, and I use them for so many other thinks outside of working out, but if you're looking for some AirPods to use while working out and you're a sweaty Betty, I'd look to get ones that are built with a bit more of a sports mode.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Apple Product I purchased from Amazon,"







  
  
    I was a little skeptical about buying apple products from amazon because I wasn't sure if it was going to be legit. But I was definitely proved wrong. I was originally going to purchase my AirPods through apple but to be honest, I found a cheaper price through Amazon. So I decided instead of paying $159+$29 (apple care+) + $15.04 (tax to ship to my location) Equaling it all out to $203.04.  I decided to buy the AirPods from Apple's store via Amazon for a total of $136.72 ( $128.98+ $7.74 (TAX). I also purchased AppleCare + for Headphones ( 2 Years ) Protection(A Must Have whenever buying anything Apple! It will save you a lot of money and heartache if something goes wrong!!) for $31.32 ($29.00 + $2.32 (TAX). So the total price of everything would have been $168.04 ; But I had 2 gift cards (one for $18.68 and one for $136.72) which knocked the prices of the AppleCare insurance down to $12.64 and the AirPods down to $0.00.  The great thing about being an Amazon Prime Member is most of the  time you don't have to pay for shipping!!!. I read the reviews for these AirPods and a lot of people were saying to make sure it says ""PRIME"" before you buy and that was definitely worth it. I've always wanted a pair of AirPods ever since they came out but I didn't want to rush to buy them when my other apple headphones that came with my iPhone 7 Plus (that I've had since 2018 with no problems) were working just fine. Of course with any pair of wired headphones, there is always the wires getting tangled. But luckily with AirPods you don't have that issue.  I wouldn't say I'm cheap but when it comes to products that are of excellent quality and are built to last like Apple; It is definitely worth spending a good amount of cash for them. So all in all, I save a ton of money and my AirPods work like a dream. I Love My New Toy.

    I was reluctant to spend this much on a non-necessity for myself but I am so glad that I did. I listen to podcasts all day at work and only wear one headphone so I am still able to communicate. I am on my feet all day running around. I used to wear corded headphones and would snag the cord if it was popping out of my shirt and it would rip the bud out of my ear and I would go through sets quickly.Now that I have these I am able to leave one in the case and switch them out as one dies so there is always one charged. The charge lasts about 6 hours  per bud and between the buds and the case, I am only plugging them in to charge about every 4 days. With these I am able to set up a queue of my podcasts and keep my phone in my desk all day. I have the double tap feature set up to pause on both so I can easily stop my podcasts to have a conversation. I love not having my phone on me or cords hanging from me. They sound great and I can’t think of a single issue I’ve had with them over the past 6 or so months. Maybe there are more affordable versions but so far I am loving these. I would highly recommend them and can’t imagine how the newer/more expensive versions could be any better :)

    These bevies are the right thing to do. I have tried so many other and wasted my money. The noise cancellation when worn with the mike down is not as strong as when worn upside down. Try them, it is a new experience. I wore my wired pods upside down for the same reason, they seal your ear canal to the outside noise and don’t hurt your ears. Of course every one is anatomically different, but it is my experience. Great product. A little expensive in price, but worth every penny. The sound is amazing, they did not look like they have the quality of sound, but they do.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Pricey but great fit, and the sound is very very good","







  
  
    These are the Apple Airpods Gen-2, not wireless charging, and not the Pro (I hate the round rubber tips that everyone seems to love).  First of all, these are very easy to use.  The sound is fantastic.  I suppose I am an audiophile since I love music... the sound is clear, balanced, and the bass is very present.  The advantage is that the design of these airpods does not require you to jam rubber tips in your ears, and the quality of the sound is therefore dependent on the tips staying in place; which, most of the time they do not.  If I have to keep reaching up to readjust the buds for a better sound, what happened to the hands-free experience? Also, I am not sure what some people do to get the Apple Airpods Gen-2 to fall out of their ears.  I have literally tried to accomplish that and unless you go full-on metal head mode I don't think you can do it.  So, let me make it easy for you, and do take my word... I have read reviews by people who were using, and listening to God knows what.  Pros:Great sound, easy to use, nice size case... some tws earbuds have those cases that are so huge, YEESH! Also, very secure and comfortable fit.  Cons:  the Voice Memos app on the iPhone is affected... when you record with those on you will get a sound as though you were on the other side of a phone line and not in the same room.  They are great for working out and listening to your music, podcasts, etc, also, only one gesture per earbud.  I found the Ticpods and will try them today.  They have the same Apple design... no crazy rubber tips.  You get a lot more gestures, and if the sound is like that of Apple I will be returning my Apple airpods. Update, the sound of those pods was not in anyway bad, the fit was ok, slightly too large,  and I prefer the opened balanced Apple sound. The tick pods gave me more of the Bose sound, it’s not as opened, it’s more compressed.  Last... I don't care about noise cancelation... unless I am on a plane; and even then... I hate to purposefully deprive myself of one of my so important senses; it intuitively feels like a really bad idea.  Here is an update A few months later:  The Apple AirPods are simply a wonderful product. I know they’re pricey but they’re that good. The sound, the fit, the look, great

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Prime Day Purchase,"







  
  
    There are much better reviews to read, but I wanted to clear something up. First, I’m not an audiophile and mostly am using these to listen to books as I do other things. However, they are much easier to use than other wireless earbuds I have bought before; just pair once and they remain paired. Take one out if somebody is talking to you, put it back in and it starts up in the same place. Battery is long lasting and just a few minutes of top off can get you more hours. You can hear background noises of course, so you don’t feel isolated. I really can’t speak to noise cancellation so I gave it a three star review but others are more knowledgeable.The one thing I wanted to clear up-these earbuds are 2nd gen, but maybe the case is 1st gen. I think that is confusing some people. The charging light is inside and it’s wired to charge, but when you look under settings you can see the actual earbuds are 2nd gen.Mine were new and definitely from Apple. Oh, and I have small ears and normally find earbuds painful but I’ve been wearing these for two days without issues. My only problem is that I have very long hair and if I sweep it back I sometimes knock one out. When I’m home it’s normally in a ponytail so no big problem. I may get something to keep them around my neck when I use them outside of the house and it’s something long-haired men and women might need to think about.I didn’t realize how annoying having tangled wires for earbuds was. I should have gotten two pair, one for home and one for out. Oh well, next Prime Day!

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great combination of functionality and price,"







  
  
    I bought these for multiple uses: music, podcasts, conference calls and watching training and YouTube videos.  I’m sure someone who is knowledgeable in audio products could better vouch for the sound quality of these versus the newer versions, I’m just an everyday guy and these work perfectly for all the uses I’ve mentioned.I’m an Apple ecosystem guy, and the seamless and instant pairing and compatibility were the main reason I got these instead of knock offs.  I’ve tried the cheap route before and from intermittent pairing/dropping, to being completely unable to use with multiple devices, and these were worth the extra money to avoid that.They average about 2-4 hours of use per charge, and with the quick recharge of the case I’ve never had to worry about dead earphones.  I love these, the newer versions might be technically better, but for the value I don’t think you can beat these.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,GREAT for running!!!!,"







  
  
    I LOVE THESE! I have been wanting to go wireless for running, and my partner and I wanted to each wear one of the set as we ran together. He was paranoid that these would fall out, so we tried two other types first (jaybird Runs - JUNK in every way, and Apple beats - way too quiet and hurt my ears). I finally convinced him to give these a shot, and they have been amazing! They do not budge at all when we run, the sound quality is impeccable, and they are soooo comfortable! The connectivity is somewhat less strong than the Beats, but plenty enough for our use. A few people mentioned about the microphone quality being subpar, but I have to disagree! I used them today during a conference call for work, while I was walking on the treadmill, and I came through loud and clear without background noise. So happy with this purchase - wish I had done it sooner!!!!!

    Easy to set up and easy to use. Pods have a substantial weight and feel good in the ear.  Sound quality is high fidelity. Intuitive controls -tap for next selection, ask it to raise or lower volume and it does. A full charge gives ample battery life for a +/- 6-hour listening session, Recharge quickly and, generally worthy of the Apple brand. Recommend buying an aftermarket accessory kit with a silicone cover for the charger and a lariat to allow you to hang the Airpods around your neck for a short time when you want to.UPDATE MY REVIEW:  I have been enjoying my Apple AirPods for almost a year now and I want to add this to my initial review.After purchasing my AirPods, I purchased a silicone sleeve for the charger case with came with a Caribiner and a lariat to hold the Airpods and allow them to hang around my neck when I took them out of earsA few days ago I attached the carabiner to the belt loop of my jeans for an afternoon of cycling and at the end of the day,  I tossed the jeans into the wash not realizing the AirPods were still attached to the belt loop. After washing the jeans I threw them in the dryer and within a few minutes, I began to hear something solid banging around in the dryer. Upon opening the dryer, I found the silicone charger case  - empty. Searching the clothes, I discovered the charger case with the Airpods inside.I took the silicone case and the AirPods Charger out of the dryer and was very sure they were destroyed - they were NOT!  I opened the case and put the AirPods in my ears and was shocked to discover they worked as well as ever and they had no indication of damge at all.The AirPods are obviously water-resistant - My thanks to the Apple engineers for anticipating they would be used by careless old men who do some stupid things.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yeah, I wear these to bed.","







  
  
    I usually wear earbuds on low volume to bed to counter my tinnitus. It helps me sleep with soothing music. I started out with wired earbuds, but many times switching positions in bed pulled the cord out of my device, which was not good.Now I have these. I got the 2nd gen because reviews said 3rd gen were less comfortable and looser for some people and I didn't want them falling out as I slept. They work great. During the middle of the night, the power gives out, but I'm sound asleep by then. They've only fell out of my ears a few times. The nice thing is that I can switch positions in bed without worrying about the cord!

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,My Wife Loves Them,"







  
  
    I bought these for my wife as a present and she absolutely loves them.  She has smaller ears and it's hard for her to find comfortable earphones.  She really liked the ones that come with iPhones but she would catch the wire on everything.  I bought her some Bluetooth ones that just didn't fit right so she never used them.These were exactly what she needed.  The fit her smaller ears and keep her cord-free.  They utilize touch controls on the side of the headphones that are not buttons.  The case is just the right size to carry them in a pocket or purse and it even charges the headphones when you are storing them, even when the case is not plugged in.  So, when it says ""wired"" in the description, it means that you charge the case via USB but when you unplug it, it has its own battery that charges the ear-buds.  She's been using them for a couple of weeks so far and I don't think she has charged the case more than once.Yes, they are a bit pricey but they are definitely worth it to make her happy.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,The default choice for a reason,"







  
  
    I held out for so long on buying a pair of AirPods, I always felt like they were priced a little too high for what you get at the end of the day. I get it now though, their value is more in how these work with all your other Apple hardware than it is from the AirPods themselves.These are still to this day in 2021, one of the smallest charging cases of a pair of true wireless headphones, even though the design is unchanged from 2016 when they were announced alongside the iPhone 7/7 Plus. That’s pretty incredible for back then.In the box, you get a standard USB A to Lightning cable, the AirPods and charging case. This is the 2nd generation AirPods with the H1 chip on board for “hey Siri” functionality. It works really well and allows the AirPods to seamlessly switch between any iOS devices, TVOS, WatchOS, and newer MacOS devices. If they are connected to your iPhone and you pull out your iPad to watch a quick video, the audio from that video would be automatically routed through the Airpods. This is after the initial setup, which only requires you to hold down the pairing button and then follow the prompts in the on screen pop ups. If you open the charging case within a few inches of an iOS device, you get a cute little pop up that will display the battery level of both the AirPods and the case. Apple’s software is good and pleasant to use, that is why products like these are worth their premium prices- the tight integration of hardware and software working together to create an amazing experience that is largely unrivaled today by any other tech company.The sound quality here is good, the open style of these headphones makes it easy to hear the world around you (this can be both good and bad). There are better sounding headphones for this price, but not any that work this way. If sound quality is of great importance, perhaps look at the AirPods Pro or wait a few months until they refresh the base level AirPods with a design that has the ear tips (this is a rumor, but it’s probably a safe bet that the entry level AirPods will get a major design change).These also tie into Airplay 2, and this allows for audio sharing where one iPhone can play audio on 2 sets of AirPods. There are also other little perks like Siri will read out you iMessages to you (this can be paused or turned off entirely). There is a cool accessibility option called “live listen” you can enable it in control center. This will use your iPhone’s microphones to play the audio it hears into the AirPods. This kind of gives it an ambient or pass through mode like headphones with ANC have.If you do pick these up in 2021, just be aware that this is a nearly 2 year old product and could be replaced with a newer version as soon as March. No one ever really knows what Apple will release or when, but the chances are high. That said though, the H1 chip is likely to still be used in the soon to be released pair, so there shouldn’t be a huge difference in terms of new features.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wow,"







  
  
    This thing performs well in all of the standard headphone categories like:- great sound quality- stays in ears (at least mine - i'm a normal sized guy, 5'10"" 190lbs)- great battery life- fast charging- great noise cancelling- works amazing as a 2-way (i use it for conference calls while walking down busy streets and airports all the time and rarely get people saying that background noise is distracting)Where this thing blows away all competition is just the magic of how effortlessly it works.  Open the case lid and your phone asks you if you want to set up your new AirPods.  Once it's set up, pop them in your ear and whatever you were playing on the phone goes to your AirPods.  Then pop them out and whatever you were listening to automatically pauses.  You get helpful little sounds when the battery starts running down.  To charge them, just pop them back into their case (which itself stores probably 4 or 5 full charges for the headphones) and they'll be workable again in about a minute, and fully charged in about 10 minutes.  (I haven't actually timed this, that's just anecdotal)I get that there are much cheaper wireless headphones out there but anyone who has ever used AirPods can tell you these are another level of convenience and quality.  Once you use these you'll never go back to non-Apple products, at least not for use with an iPhone.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality and longevity,"







  
  
    I’ve had several pairs of AirPods. These are my favorite. I’m comparing them to the first gen, obvious these are an upgrade. Also, I’ve had the pros, did not like them as they fell out of my ear all the time, even with differing sized ear inserts. I own the Airpod 3 too- same problem of them falling out.The 2’s are a perfect fit for my ear as well and the pro and 3’s are painful after about 45 minutes. The controls are superior in my opinion. Tap, double tap- excellent idea and works great. The squeeze on the pro and 3, odd decision practicality-wise as you have to squeeze a specific part of the AirPods which can and does cause it to loosen in your ear and more easily fall out. Not sure why Apple did that or continues to.Only thing these don’t have is noise canceling. Doesn’t bother me though, I don’t like/need that feature. I hope they keep making the 2nd gen, I’ll keep buying them. Best on the market at the moment.

    Though these are from the 2nd generation, they are perfection! They stay nestled in my ear as no other headphone can do! I have tried without success all the headphones that are crammed into the ear canal! Alas none stay in! But the design of the Apple AirPod stay nestled in my ear! To say I love them is an understatement! They have revolutionized my listening experience. Wonderful sound and ease of use, they are with me wherever I go. I would not say they cancel all sound, nor do I desire that outcome. The battery life is about five hours of listening time and they charge at lightening speed.

    As an audiophile, I resisted getting these for a long time.  But they don’t sound bad and the convenience and ease of use is off the charts.  AirPods are a very well designed and useful accessory to any Apple device.  Battery life is acceptable given their tiny size.I bought them first for my wife, who’s never had true wireless ear buds and doesn’t care as much about sound quality as me. She’s also not particularly into gadgets and tech like I am.  She loves these things like the sister she never had.We both find that they fit well, stay put, and are comfortable, and our ears are very different size & shape.When I’m doing serious listening to music, I have other earphones I can use.  Otherwise, I reach for the AirPods because they’re so easy and a joy to use.  I’m happy I bought them.They also work great for cellular phone calls and for Zoom meetings.

    Greatest earphones ever!I don’t know how I ever lived without these, seriously, not just the earphones but the great little case that they come in that charges your ear buds even when it’s not plugged in so perfect to have when you’re traveling.The ear buds not only allow you you to  call people by simply saying “hey Siri” but it answers any questions, it reads and composed text messages if I ask, it plays music etc. etc.  Simply ask and you shall receive.I can now cook with my hands full while dancing to the beat of any song I ask Siri to play, ask Siri to take notes for me or even help give me recipe ideas.Once you’ve used these you will also ask yourself how you ever lived without it as it makes your life so much easier.The sound is fantastic  along with the noise reduction and whomever I’m speaking with hears me well.These are pricey but I assure you they are worth every penny you pay.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with these,"







  
  
    I expected to not get the same sound quality out of these as the wired version since they are the same design and it's bluetooth.  But, along with my now HD audio Amazon music account (thank you Apple!) the music sounds great!  I like the integration with Siri so that she reads texts that come in and announces calls.  Double tap feature is configurable, like my left ear is stop/start and right ear is next track.  Also, if you take one out, whatever is playing, music or video stops and then starts when you pop it back in.  Additionally, I like this ""old"" design because those new squishy rubber tipped things never stay in my ears.  Battery life is pretty good.  I haven't measured it, but I can usually get away with all day with occasional listening.  Cons: sound is a little less bass heavy, but there still is some, definitely not ""tinny"".  Battery could be better, but I mean they are tiny.  Very little to complain about really, definitely happy with this purchase, I recommend them.

     I was leery of purchasing these based on reviews stating the received used ones but, I am glad I did. They arrived still sealed and in original Apple packaging.I bought these for my 15 year old daughter and she loves them. They paired easily with her phone  She loves the sound quality and they appear to have a good battery life. She uses her AirPods daily and both sides are still working.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why have I waited this long?,"







  
  
    I am an android user, and I generally stay away from Apple products due to their higher price, and inflexibility of integration with non apple products.  My son had a pair of pods, which I tried with my Samsung Galaxy phone - when I saw how great they are, I had to purchase a pair for myself, and I have had it over over a month now.1) Pairing is effortless and quick2) Quality is amazing - crisp, clear3) Battery life has been great so far.  I've been listening to audio books while walking for 2-3 hours at a time, and battery lasted more than that without needed to recharge in the case4) I don't feel that they are in my ears.  They are so light and comfortable, that sometimes I have to touch my ear to make sure that they didn't fall off.  Any other pods, my ear starts to feel an annoying dull pain after some time - but not with these.  They've been in my ear for over 3 hours without any discomfort.5) Speaking of falling off - they won't.  The design is fantastic, so unless you're flicking them off on purpose - they will stay in the ear.  I had worked out with them (push ups, stomach crunches, etc.), and never had to adjust them.6) I am not looking for noise cancellation features with pods, because when I go for walks, I want to be able to hear ambiance noise for awareness.  While they not intended to block noise, they do a good job in transmitting strong and clear sound.  I often times have to reduce the volume to be able to still hear ambiance noise when outdoors.  Next to a busy street, I do need to increase the volume, but that's expected.I don't use the gestures much, so can't comment on their responsiveness/usefulness, but I feel like a fool for wasting money on knock off brands for a third of the price, to see how terrible terrible their quality is in comparison (sound quality, pairing dependability, comfort).  Also, this is not a wireless case, so you will need to charge with a cable.Overall, this is a solid piece of engineering that I would strongly recommend over any knockoff or other competitors.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Favorite Purchase of the Year,"







  
  
    I purchased these as a gift for my wife.  At first, she wasn't sure if she would use them but they quickly became her favorite accessory.  She uses them when watching TV on her phone and needs to walk away for a moment with no need to carry her phone with her; she hooks them up to our Apple TV and can freely move around without having to lug anything else around.  She connects to her work laptop and uses them when grading her students' multimedia projects.  They fit her well (I have a pair as well and they are quite comfortable), they have outstanding battery life (she's not one to remember to charge accessories, but these last weeks without a need for a charge), and they just work.  Who has time to fiddle with bluetooth connections and such?  Highly recommended.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy Camper,"







  
  
    I received authentic Apple AirPods and I even received them a day earlier than expected! These are definitely an upgrade from my original Gen 1 AirPods that I purchased back in 2018, thankfully. Once again, pairing to my phone is phenomenal and the battery life is long. Of course my old pair wore down over time but I believe, I’ve gotten good use out of them and I’m confident this pair will last just as long. I like the hey Siri feature and that I can even control the volume with Siri now, very cool! Sound quality is just as good as always, overall I’m satisfied. Oh, and one more thing ! These things attract dirt and dust like a magnet and scratch very easily, therefore I highly recommend a case or some form of protection for them.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good quality but over priced,"







  
  
    Good quality has some basic features you can customize in settings.  Skipping tracks or pausing the music and a few others just by double clicking what ear pod you have the settings for. Connects instantly! You can’t change the volume on it without pulling out your device unfortunately. In my opinion it’s a tad over priced. If you want them I personally wouldn’t pay more than $70. Only reason I got them was because I had gift cards that covered most of the cost so I really only paid like $40 Or so for them. Overall is it worth money not really definitely cheaper options that are probably the same quality in all honestly. If you are heart set on Apple products these are the best option. This is the OG one but personally I would get these over the new ones less to go wrong. Again only if you heart set on Apple if not get the like 30-50 dollar ones will be just about the same quality and features as these. Also buy the case with something to attach to like a purse, backpack or, pants definitely something you can lose if you travel a lot! They do appear in find my iPhone app but if they haven’t been used it will just show the last location. So someone would have to use them to keep the location up to date. Again you have to decide if this product works for you and is worth your money personally if you don’t care if it’s Apple get the cheaper one if you can’t buy non Apple these are the best ones that you can get without spending a crazy amount of money! Side note don’t buy them used! Used ones usually have issues that Apple won’t cover unless you buy Apple care so unless you want to buy Apple care on used ones just buy them new!

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing buy,"







  
  
    Ok soooo I had some previous air pods that were a gift from two years ago and they were OK, but I decided to get a new pair of AirPods. Reading the reviews I was SUPER skeptical because I didn’t want to spend my money and get a horrible pair of AirPods only to have to return them. These AirPods are AMAZINGGGGG. The sound quality on these AirPods are WAYY better than the AirPods that I have had for two years. The base in these AirPods are better (pshhh who am I kidding my other AirPods didn’t have base like these do HONESTLY 🥴) the sound quality is better. They look exactly the same as my previous pair of AirPods but sound wise it’s a huge upgrade and I’m so happy with my purchase.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good for small ears. More convenient than coulda imagined!,"







  
  
    Honestly I thought these airpods were just all hype, another thing apple put out for you to buy and blah, blah, blah. But man I cannot say how wrong I was. These things are so freakin convenient! You can wear one ear and still get awesome benefits with or wear both if your in a situation where you don't need to hear your surroundings. When my phone mic on my phone is acting stupid and people cant hear me on calls, this eliminates the problem completely,  plus i can get stuff done not having to hold the phone.I should address my subject about the ears. I have tiny ears and these fit great!  I had read reviews about the pro and other versions just were too big so I am really happy I got these. They dont hurt like some oflther buds if u have small ears and they dont fall out. I havent jogged with them yet so will have to see how that goes.They connect so easily to your phone and if you have the watch as well, it automatically syncs as your phone does. Wish i had gotten these a long time ago because they are really more than I coulda imagined.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"It's Airpods, everyone should have a pair","







  
  
    This is my third pair of Airpods, which may seem strange to some, given they first came out in 2016, however if you use these as much as I do you will wear the battery out over time. Since the charging case is pocket size you can always carry these with you and since the case contains a seperate battery they're always charging in your pocket. Connecting is a breeze, 1. Open flap, 2. Do you wish to connect airpods ? -> Connect 3. Done...Airpods with or without wireless charging case?I have a wireless charging pad and a lightning cable next to my bed and rarely used the pad for wireless charging of these, would just stick with the lightning charged case if you don't need a full charge every day. I only need to charge weekly and since you can charge the case without having the airpods in the case I sometimes plonk it in the charger when I'm going to do stuff around the house and want to use the airpods.Airpods or Airpods Pro ?I have both kinds and I really like both types, for different scenarios. When using public transport or really need noise cancelling the Pro's shine, however for extended use, > 1 hour, when riding a bike, out for a walk, eating and listening I go for the classic airpods, they're just more comfortable to wear, you barely know they're there....

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect PERFECT performance and fit.,"







  
  
    Good sound, though I’m 63 and not an audiophile.  But you can’t beat them for convenience.  Great for walking due to Siri based controls.  Siri also let’s me look unfamiliar words while listening to audiobooks, which I love.  Only earbuds I’ve ever found that stay in my ears, yet so light and comfortable that I forget I have them in.  Not exactly a fashion statement in my opinion.  I joke that, with the white protuberances going down out of the years of an older guy, it looks like his hearing aids are melting.  But yeah, very very good and reliable product, pairs perfectly every time with no dropped signal, really excellently designed all the way around.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Happy with my purchase,"







  
  
    I purchased these after having to return the AirPods Pro.  I have small ears and I am one of the few people who can't wear the AirPods pro without discomfort and without them falling out of my ears.  So, very sadly, I had to return those and ""settle"" for these.  I feel very happy with these.  The sound is fine, obviously not as good as the Pro's, and they don't have noise cancellation (which was nice).  But Apple has a very solid product here.  These DO stay in my ears, and are not uncomfortable.  I like how they automatically pair with my Apple devices.  Unfortunately, I cannot get them to pair with my work issued laptop.  Also, although I did get them to pair with my Dell personal laptop, I cannot adjust the volume no matter what I try, and I'm not the only one with the issue. I googled it and lots of people are trying to resolve this issue.  It will literally deafen me, so I cannot use the with my laptop, which is disappointing.  It seems to be a problem with the Dell Inspiron version, and maybe not Apple.  Either way, will not work satisfactorily.  I do use them with my Apple watch, and i love them for that.  Overall, pretty happy!
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,These things are pretty great,"







  
  
    I love being able to throw these things in my pocket. I felt they looked a little goofy at first, but I got over that. They don't advertise these ones as noise cancelling, but I swear they do cancel out some of the outside noise, and I don't think that's just in my head, either. They aren't cheap, but I have a pair of these and a pair of Beats Studio Earphones, and that way I can go either way, which usually means I use the AirPods for walks, or going out, and the Earphones are for the beach, or at home (is it just me or is it just a little scary being basically deaf to the world around you at times?)I think they ought to include these with the purchase of the expensive phones that Apple sells, but that's just me.One last thing-supposedly the newer generation are more sweat resistant than these ones, but I haven't had any issues there, so I'm not sure what that's all about. It's not like I'm a marathon runner, but I have worn these in the summer on long walks, and besides cleaning them with a q-tip here and there, there's no issues.The battery life is about 2 hours, maybe a hair less than that, but if you just bring the case with you, you put them back in there and about 15-20 minutes later they're charged again. The case itself needs to be charged every so often, which roughly translates to every 2-3 days, or every 3 charges. They last a long time if they're just sitting in the drawer, not on the charger, which makes them available to use pretty much at all times. As the corny cliche goes, I don't leave home without them.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works great!,"







  
  
    I have always considered AirPods a waste of money until I actually got them! I got a new job of course where you can’t listen to music so I got these to hide the fact I was listening to music because basically you have to wait your turn to bag groceries for 10-30 minutes depending how busy it is and just stare at the customers and look around and wait your turn, and having these makes the day a lot better! Also I go on lots of family road trips and earbud cords get in the way when your eating or doing something but these AirPods are so easy to use and there’s no cords to bother you! And when you need to charge them and your on the road you don’t need to fight to charge something because if the case is fully charged it can charge the AirPods from dead battery to 100% in like 15 minutes and then when you get to a hotel you can charge your phone and AirPods for the next day! And a charger comes with these too so I recommend getting a wall charger with two usb plug ins so you can charge your AirPods and iPhone at the same time, and charge everything at once!

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great sound and fit,"







  
  
    I had a pair of SENSO Bluetooth headphones and they had served me well and after a couple of years I wanted to go wireless, since the wire between each earpiece was bothersome, but I didn’t want to spend a lot for the gym and was worried about the fit with Apples AirPods. The price drop on the Apple AirPods was too good to pass up and I upgraded. My concern about the fit and them not fitting and possible falling out while exercising and out for a run we’re quickly dismissed. They fit very good, stay in place deliver excellent sound and the battery life is excellent also. The charge quickly and I went with the wired charging since I still use the Apple lightning cord on my phone and would use that charger. These were a great trade up and I am very p,eased with the Apple AirPods. The AirPods themselves offer many features including Siri, and other options but too much to write up, if your interested read the “about this item” notes in Amazon’s page.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,The perfect tool for WFH,"







  
  
    Day 2 of my WFH experience I realized I needed wireless audio capability to be more effective on video and audio teleconferences.  With meetings usually lasting one hour, and my schedule often having back-to-back meetings, it would be nice if the battery life were a little longer than the 3 hours. However, understanding that batteries add weight, and current technology is what it is, I'll go with bluetooth airpods any day! Just remember to park them in the recharger module between meetings so you don't have to switch to wired audio. These also work well when you're WFH with a significant other and you both need your own professional space, even if in an apartment.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Yep! These are Great! Just a few Minor Drawbacks, but Otherwise are as Advertised!","







  
  
    As many have said before, the batt life on these Airpods is nothing short of  great! The case is the key to extended  life. Comfort? For most people, the comfort level is outstanding. My left ear does have issues different from most, so the unit keeps popping out during exercise. Installing the little slip covers seemed to correct this. (Silicon based) I've heard a few complaints regarding sound quality. Not so for me. I just twist them a bit so the main speaker is directed to my ear canal, and the sound is about the best I've heard. These are great for the price, and I predict the Pro version prices will go down after the holidays if you want to hold off and spend up to 50% less. The only real difference with the Pro version is the end pieces. (Will stay in your ears  better than standard.) I paid $165.00 for these. Worth every penny I think!
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Exactly what I wanted/needed,"







  
  
    They are exactly what I wanted/needed. I Really like the version 2 AirPods as a  replacement for my first ones. (Didn’t want the newer ones with the pads that stick more into your ears... my ears would not be happy.  Luckily I don’t have a problem with the original designed airpods falling out of my ears).  NOTE:  Batteries  lasts longer, sound is good, has hands free  hey seri, and still uses the lightning port to charge like all my other apple devices.  I use them with either iPhone X Max Pro or Apple watch 4.  I don’t use them to listen to music.  I usually wear one in my left ear only to take:make phone calls, get notifications & directions, ask seri questions or give commands/get directions etc. . If the battery starts running low I put the right airpod in while the left one is charging.  Saved me $$$ also... as using airpods prevents me from getting a traffic ticket as we can’t get caught using or looking at a phone while driving (even while stopped at a stoplight !!!).

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love my air pods.,"







  
  
    This is the second time I’ve bought these air pods. I love them! Very good quality and comfortable. They fit my ears very well snd don’t fall out. The price was also very reasonable for the quality. It came in nice sealed box and brand new. The battery lasts really long on the case. I don’t charge it every day. Depends on how much I use them but can generally go a few days without charging case. When wearing these I can pretty much hear when someone talks to me yet they are good enough that I can hear what I’m listening even if someone in room is watching tv. To me I would not want 100% noise cancelling because that doesn’t seem safe to me. I like that I can control them on the pod itself or my phone. I’m very pleased with my purchase and would buy them a third time if needed. I feel no need to buy newer air pods with very little features I don’t get with these. I recommend to my brother and he bought some fir himself and our mother and they love them as well. My son also has them and is very happy with them. Highly recommend these! The price is half what the newest air pods are but the quality is not. Excellent quality and price.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,I wish I'd bought them sooner--Very useful for persons with hearing issues,"







  
  
    These are COOL!  This is truly something I wish I'd purchased months ago.They are easy to set up, just flip open case and they connect.  Not sure how long one charge lasts--haven't used them long term.  Seem pretty secure and mostly stay in place, but get a bit uncomfortable after a few hours. (I think they're a bit too big for my ears.)  Sound quality is wonderful.  I have hearing aids that are supposed to be able to allow me to listen to music and calls on my iPhone, but sound quality is awful, so I never used either feature.  The first time I got an incoming call with these in place, I was surprised and pleased by how easy it was to fully understand the call without having to switch to speaker phone.I plan to try using my phone in meetings as a way of streaming other's voices directly into my ears.  I will be really nice to not miss half of what others say, or to get whiplash from turning my head back & forth to look at whomever is speaking as I try to read their lips.  I understand that it's possible to put the phone in front of a TV and have it relay the sound directly to the Air Pods.  I currently don't need to do that because I can just pair them with the Roku app on my phone, but will try it out when visiting family to see if it will allow me to hear the TV better.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent buy!,"







  
  
    I am extremely happy with these AirPods, they are amazing!  They automatically play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out.  How great is that?? Then while listening a simple double-tap will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" . When you're on a call or talking to Siri, apple technology filters out background noise and ensure that your voice is transmitted with clarity and consistency.Whats even more impressive they deliver five hours of listening time on a single charge, and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time. Just 15 minutes in the case gives you about three hours of listening to time or up to two hours of talk time. These are my first airpods so I can not compare with the first gen, but I highly highly reccommend these airpods.The breakdown on how I determine my star rating of a product…5 stars – I love it! It is awesome and I highly recommend that everyone purchase this product!4 stars – I like it. Not everything can be perfect! I would purchase again.3 stars – It was okay, but I would probably not buy it again unless I had no other choices.2 stars – There may be worse products out there, but you can definitely find better choices.1 star – I dislike the product, I wish I had not purchased it and do not recommend anyone else to purchase it.If my review helped please take a second and click that it was helpful below.

    I purchased these for my husband for father's day. I kept going back and forth between the Bose SoundSport and the Airpods. I have the QC35 and I love them for work since they are noise-cancelling. For my husband's purposes (at work, when doing yardwork, etc.) he did not headphones at the QC35's level. Overall it was the ease of the airpods and the charging case that really drove my purchase. It's been one week (opened them early) and he loves them-- the only hesitation I have is him losing them (so compact!). For everyday use and ease of use with apple products I would definitely recommend.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,UNDERRATED BUT EXCELLENT AIRPODS!!,"







  
  
    I’m very impressed.  The sound quality is actually extremely good with these 2nd Generation AirPods.  They also fit really well in my ears.  THEY ARE EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE.  You don’t even really feel them in your ears, and they don’t fall out either. I’ve heard that for some people the 3rd Gen AirPods are too big for their ears, but not these. They are a perfect size really, and they deliver excellent sound.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I'm glad I bit the bullet, and purchased the real deal instead of knockoffs.","







  
  
    I've purchased 3 different knockoffs, and each one was terrible. I ""bit the bullet"", spent the mega amount of money for the ""cadillac"" brand, and am satisfied with the generation one airpods. Unlike the knockoffs, these earbuds don't drop connection, and stay synced with one another. If you're like me, and are hesitant because of the amount of money the apple brand cost, you'll get more for your money buying the official brand. I've spent the same amount collectively on the three other ""airpods"" being $130 instead of buying these in the first place. Now, if we're to look at it like this, in the end I've spent $260 😥 I would include a picture of the airpods, but anyone reading this can just as easily google image search 'apple airpods generation one"". What I received is exactly as described.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Good middle-of-the-road option,"







  
  
    I purchased these wireless earbuds after receiving defective AirPod Pros, and I’m glad I “downgraded.” I normally have trouble fitting silicone seal earbuds in my ears, so the fact that these just sit in the outer ear is actually a plus for me. Connecting them to my Apple devices (watch, iPhone, iPad) was very easy, and almost instant. I have not tried connecting them to Android phones or Windows computers, so I’m not sure how well they work for those devices.For an audio device that doesn’t cancel sound, the sound quality is amazing. They are probably a little better than the stock iPhone wired earbuds, for reference. Nothing crazy, but I’m pleased with them. Since they don’t cancel sound, I can also wear them around the house or out on walks with my dog without the fear that someone will try to get my attention and I won’t hear them.As someone who almost never buys warranties, I would highly recommend the 2-year AppleCare+ subscription for these AirPods, since it covers everything from damage, to theft, to loss.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great purchase for those who use phone or listen alot,"







  
  
    Love these. Took me a few years to finally purchase because of the cost, but would 100% recommend buying if you are on the fence. They are super easy to use, very lightweight and they work great! They connect to my phone without problems 99% of the time and the sound quality is perfect. They are far superior to any other headphones I have used and will never use anything else.After having them for a good 6 months now, there are rare times where they have issues connecting. Its not a major complaint and it never stays that way, just occasionally they just wont connect. I usually just place them back in the case and the next time they work fine.

    I have been a gym workout Rat for many years. I presently workout at my gym 3 daws a week, 2hours each. I find workouts good, tough and can be boring. My gym played music at one time, but then it was discontinued. I purchased a Sandisk, Sansa Clip with 2 memory cards and used it for years until it no longer worked. Then I started noticing these people with white stems hanging out their ears, looked funny. When I checked into these, I found that they were air and ear pods. One of my friends let me try his Apple AirPods. I was very impressed until I heard the price. As a result over the next couple of months, I purchased two other brands at $45.00 each. Both had technical issues, so I finally returned them and purchased the more expensive Apple AirPods, 2nd generation and since then, I have never looked back. Easy setup, easy music selection and easy streaming. So now I am one of the gym rats that walks around with White things hanging out his ears. Great decision.

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,How did I live without these?,"







  
  
    I have had other ear buds from all kinds of companies, I wish I could afford a Bose, but I can’t. My brother said I should try them, so On prime day I splurged. This was the first time that I listened to music and I could hear the small nuances of instruments in the background. Some of them I never knew were there, or talking at the end of the song, and it was clear.I can hear people very well and they tell me they can hear me very well also. And I am slightly hard of hearing, so being on the phone with the earbuds is the best thing ever.If you ever want to know how great these earbuds are, and it might not be your thing, but put on a Depeche Mode song. You’ll be astonished at what you can hear. If you don’t have a pair of these you’re really should- Worth every penny.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Like better than new 3rd generation airports and AirPods Pro,"







  
  
    They are easier to use and stay in ear better than the AirPods Pro and 3rs gen.  Sound is just as good.  Only thing I miss is noise cancellation and the ability to click on AirPods to start and stop the song.  Full disclosure I own AirPods Pro as well and used to have 3rd Gen that I tried and returned.  True you can double tap the 2nd Gen to stop start sound but the click on newer are better. Other than that I prefer these.

    I love these Airpods! I like that they're easy to use. If you take one pod out, it automatically pauses the music which is really cool. They automatically connect when you put them in your ear and automatically disconnect when you put them in the case. easy to charge, same charger cord as the iPhone uses. I didn't want to get any earphones with that rubbery material because I feel like that is too difficult to clean and it catches more germs. So I prefer the plastic-y material ear phones. The sound is good quality. For me, it was worth the money. I tried quite a few off-brand, cheaper, wireless earnphones, but they were all crap. Airpods are the real deal

    This is my first pair of AirPods. I love them. They are life-changing! The AirPods arrived in less than 24-hours of ordering. They were packaged in a sleek, white Apple AirPods box. I did not buy the ""noise-canceling"" AirPods, so I cannot rate that feature, but as far as the product appearance, sound quality, ease of use, great fit, easy to pair on Bluetooth, etc. I wholeheartedly give these AirPods 5 shiny gold starts.

    I was on the fence for quite awhile about whether I needed these as I own everything Apple, but I held back and that was a mistake! Apple quality SHINES once again! Everything about these is exactly as you would expect from Apple, you really do get what you pay for! I am very pleased with the airpods, I am enjoying them as I write this review, the sound is absolutely excellent! I had zero issues setting them up with my Iphone. The quality in craftsmanship and quality is pure Apple, The sound is amazingly excellent! They are comfortable to wear. I have not tried any heavy duty physical activity with them on but I'm sure there are other reviews here that cover that. I waited too long! The price is reasonable for something that will give you many years of pleasure!

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,it's not all hype,"







  
  
    i bought this because i wanted to try a true wireless earphones for the first time. i wanted to avoid it at first since everybody seems to have it, but it is undeniable that it is one of the best in the market right now so i bought it. its pretty amazing. the sound quality is pretty good. it has a total of 10 hours battery life with the charging case. you can do touch commands on it and ask siri questions if youre connected to wifi or data. its slick and easy to charge and use. you can set up the touch commands in the iphone. you can check the battery life if you open the case near to the iphone. it can be connected with android but it does lose some of its function like siri. JUST DONT LOSE AN EARPHONE BECAUSE ITS EXPENSIVE LIKE CRAZY. TO BE SPECIFIC ITS 75 DOLLARS OR SO DEPENDING ON THE TAX.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,AirPod gets the nod,"







  
  
    I picked these up at a slight discount.  I've been curious about AirPods for years now.  I was always discouraged by the steep price and so for the longest time, i settled for ""budget earbuds"".  My AirPods (second generation) arrived today and I don't typically rush onto Amazon to write a review but these things are spectacular.  I love the Siri integration, the customizable double tap feature, the crisp and clear audio when listening to everything from music to podcasts...even the charging case is a sleek looking device.  Pairing your Airpods to your iPhone, iPad, or any bluetooth device really, is a total breeze (but most especially when it comes to other iOS devices.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,I use them everyday,"







  
  
    I have an iPhone and wanted a good pair of wireless headphones but without Apple's price. After trying about 6 different brands and returning them or just wasting money on them I decided to bite the bullet and just get the Air Pods, now I wish I did it sooner. They sound great, I like that I can just say Hey Siri to change the volume, and they are so useful. I use them daily when working by either listening to music when working on a project or talking to customers, I also use them when mowing the lawn or just running to the store. These do not noise canceling but they isolate the background noise well but not to the point where you cant hear around you. I am surprised on how long the battery actually lasts for such a small package, also the storage case/charger is great because if I am running low on power I just plug them in for 15 min or so and have enough power to take several more calls.I would recommend these to others and I am even going to buy a pair for my fiance to replace her off the wall wireless earbuds.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product,"







  
  
    These are genuine, confirmed the serial number with Apple.This is my second pair. After constant use for phone calls for 2 years the batteries in the AirPods were only lasting 30-40 minutes when used for phone calls.5-6 hours a day I talk on the phone using these and everyone says they can't even tell I'm on bluetooth which is an impressive feat considering how small they are.I hope this pair treats me as well as my first pair did.I highly recommend these if you are looking for a bluetooth headset for phone calls. The batteries dont last as long as some but you can keep swapping between using one at a time.
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Pre-Christmas iPhone air buds function well during the holiday season,"







  
  
    Apple airpods were delivered a little later than the prime usual, but understandably so due to the pre-Christmas rush. They perform well and the sound is good. The only two considerations are that they don’t fit perfectly into my ear canals as each one is a bit differently shaped. Consequently the noise reduction and the sound quality would be better if they fit more snugly. That being said the Wi-Fi works seamlessly and is greatly improved over the directly wired EarPods I initially received with my Apple X plus phone. The other consideration is that they only hold a charge somewhere between four and five hours. So when I was out Christmas shopping all day one day, the audio faded out after four hours in one year and about 4 1/2 and the other. But I was grateful for those hours. So if these air buds remain functional for a year I may invest in the air Bud pros next Christmas.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Can't believe I waited to buy!!,"







  
  
    My original bluetooth, over the ear, hands-free device was starting to drop calls after having it for five years.  I was in the hunt for a new device and was debating on whether to purchase these.  I absolutely LOVE THEM!I was afraid that they would not stay in my ears, especially as I love to hike and do yoga.  I have had no issues with them staying in, even in upside down yoga positions.  They are very comfortable and the sound is amazing.  The battery life is extensive and if I need to charge the pods, I just pop then in the charger for 3 minutes and an able to get more life.There are only two negatives, in my opinion.  One, I cannot connect to more than one device at a time like I did with old bluetooth device.  This is a pain for me as I have a personal and work cell phone, so I have to make a choice to which device I will connect to.  Two, when I receive a call, I have to physically look at my phone or Apple watch to see who is calling and physically answer it.  My old bluetooth device would tell me who was calling and I could respond by saying ""answer"" or ""ignore.""  Even though these are big negatives for me, they are 100% worth every penny.  They were cheaper on Amazon than the Apple store and I did not have to leave my house to get them.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,OVERALL BEST IN CLASS!,"







  
  
    I have to say that I just got these AirPods and I LOVE them! Just to state my bias upfront: I love Apple products, but I’m not an Apple fanboy. LolsPROS: The sound quality is fantastic. I have owned Bose and Jam ultra earbuds. These are on par with the Bode product. Though I have never owned the first generation of the AirPods. I like how easy it is to pair these with my iPhone. It was so quick and simple. The Bose and Jam were cumbersome at times, often I would have to unpair and repair them to get them working again. No such thing with the AirPods. I love the small container that stores and charges them. It just looks and feel nice in your hand too. The Bose were big and clunky and the Jam Ultra case was huge and made a bulge in my pocket.CONS: My negatives for the AirPods are small and very trivial. I wish that they were a little more snug in my ear. The Bose and Jam earbuds did fit more snugly in my ear hole. Also with the AirPods it doesn’t give me a battery level status at the top of my phone screen. See my uploaded picture. The Bose and Jam Ultra both had a battery level status bar next to the headphone icon at the top of my phone screen. With the AirPods I have to get the case and open it to get a status of the battery level. Very insignificant, but it is something.I love these AirPods and am extremely happy with them! I highly recommend these earbuds!

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Expensive but worth the purcahse,"







  
  
    I bought these because I do a lot of off-the-floor shifts at my work, which means I can listen to my music while I work. I figured these would be much more convenient for this, so I caved and bought the airpods. And I gotta say, even though I personally do not care much for Apple, these things are fantastic. The sound quality is nearly perfect, great bass capabilities too, and they are honestly almost as good as the headset I use for my computer (Which is a corsair).My only gripe is with the battery life on them. They die pretty quickly. They didn't last a 5.5-hour shift on at my work from a full charge when I started. Granted, they charge very quickly with the case. Mine went from about 8% to 98% in 23 minutes (I did time the charge). They also appear to just drain even when not in use, not at a fast pace but still. So you'd have to keep them in the charging case when not in use and the case also needs to be charged as well, not that I wasn't expecting this side effect. Aside from this small inconvenience, I have not had any issues with these and I'm very impressed with the quality.They also fit as expected, don't fall out super easily, and are able to be used for phone calls better than the default mic my phone has.I must applaud Apple for this one, they did a great job. I highly recommend them and I have no doubt Apple will take advantage of the success and keep developing and improving them.

    I’m not exactly sure how long I’ve had these AirPods but it’s been a long time. If you take care of them they won’t let you down. The only problem I’ve had it sometimes it doesn’t detect that it’s in my ears and I have to take them out and cover the sensors with my fingers to force it. I haven’t lost any audio in either pod so it’s still going strong. The audio is clear and relatively good bass. For some people they can fall out easily but I’ve gone running and trail biking and it hasn’t fallen out once.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Air Pods stolen by fellow Airmen in Tech School. Sad.,"







  
  
    My son, who was attending his Air Force technical training left his AirPods Pro to use the restroom. Low and behold he comes back into the training room and they are gone. He was upset because they were a gift for his graduation. Also, because it showed his fellow airman who took them lacked INTEGRITY. SO, It made him think about what might happen on the battleground. Would this person have his back? I bought him another pair not as expensive as the original. He is grateful and loves these as well. He just really loves the AirPod Pros. I can save up to get them again one day. Thanks for listening. 😡😀

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,A Great Price for Wires No More!,"







  
  
    Lets face it these AirPods are by Apple so you know that they are excellent quality.  I absolutely LOVE them and after having them for just one day wonder how I managed without them.  For volume control either have Siri adjust the volume or do it manually.PRO  I love the fact that if an AirPod happens to fall from your ear the media that you were streaming will be paused until the AirPod is reinserted, very cool.  I also love that once inserted in ears an on screen charge status shows up, also very cool.  I bough a clear silicone case for the AirPods Charging case as 1- Its very small and slick so could easily fall from hands  2- Better protection in event of contact with water (rain).  For less than 150 USD you have these marvellous EarPods which is a fantastic buy IMO.CON  I suspect that these are Generation 1 AirPods as there is no LED charging indicator light on the front of the case. No biggie as to check charge status simply take out & reinsert in one ear & onscreen status appears. Another con is that there is absolutely no noise cancelling ability whatsoever.  It's just like using wired ear buds, unless you have a high volume (not recommended if you still want hearing after age 60) you will hear the surrounding noise.While the latest series of EarPods does offer the noise cancelling ability, you will pay for it accordingly.  I am quite happy with these EarPods and if you don't need the noise cancelling feature, I'm certain you will be too.

    My husband surprised me and bought these for me on Prime Day.  I've never been a 'head phone' person, always preferred to listen to my music w/o an interface. I still don't like anything in my ears, but these are really terrific. My main focus is classical music which has been a life-long passion. Music sounds crystalline; bass is good, not gut shaking like my stereo system, but still fine; trebble is good as well.Now I've put apps for my favorite classical staions on my phone so I can listen to them sitting on my lanai. I can also listen to my old iPod which has so much of my favorites on it. Now when the Saturday opera matinee is playing, I can listen with my air pods. While my husband likes classical, he still hates opera!

    I ordered the APPLE AirPods  with Charging Case (without noise cancelling feature) on a Saturday night along with one other item that I normally get. The orders arrived Monday afternoon (Labor Day) together in a sealed Amazon box on my doorstep, a day earlier than promised. These AirPods are the real Apple (made in Vietnam) product and came sealed in their APPLE certified packaging with warrantee papers (1 year) and instructions. I paired and tested the AirPods with both my iPhone and my Windows 10 PC - easy to figure out based on the instructions included. Great high fidelity sound quality and they are so comfortable, I forget about them. I walk most days while listening to NPR news radio or Amazon music. I also watch news and movies on my PC in my room on Apple wired earphones - but I think I'll switch to using the AirPods from now on. These are perfect for my needs. And they were offered at a reduced price on Amazon. Thank you, APPLE. Thank you, Amazon.

    Shame on me. I held off purchasing AirPods because I heard things like  ""they fall out of your ear easily,"" ""the battery does not last more than a couple of hours,"" and you have to recharge often,"" once again shame on me. I tried many of the off brands to save money but did not work well, the sound quality was poor, and some of the batteries only lasted an hour. I saw the special on Amazon for the AirPods and I bit the bullet and bought them,  and I found that everything I had heard was incorrect. I am an apple forever customer for a reason. The sound quality is amazing and I cannot tell they are in my ears at all. I wear mine for workouts, work, running, and when I am in my car. They stay in my ears for 12 to 13 hours out of the day. I do not recharge during the day and only recharge the case once every 3 days WOW is all I have to say.

    First of all, they’re legit & REAL AirPods -I got sold a pair of pretty real looking knock offs from a cell phone store in PERSON, so don’t be like me and be naive, there’s a tonnnn of people out there selling knock offs that look very similar... I verified the serial numbers on these through Apples website and all came back just fine.It should be noted these are NOT the wireless charging ones, however. I made a mistake and overlooked this in the description as some others have also, but I’m not bothered by it at all really.Worth investing in the 2 year Apple Care plan for the additional $29 or $30... if you’re already dropping $120 on a pair of headphones, may as well invest in the coverage... esp in my case, I can see accidentally misplacing one or something lol.Overall, very happy with this product and received within one day. They sound great and definitely worth the money.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"YES THEY ARE 1st GEN, but they are still great!","







  
  
    I bought these to use at work instead of my over the ear beats because wearing those huge headphones isn’t a great look at work. I wasn’t expecting them to sound amazing, but the sound quality is comparable to my beats that were 3x the price. They are definitely by apple; I’ve watched enough YouTube videos to be able to spot fakes. Mine are definitely 1st gen. This is how you can tell:If the picture on the back of the box includes the charger, it is 1st gen. The 2nd gen AirPod box doesn’t feature a picture of the charging cable on the back; all you’d see are the AirPods in their case. The 2nd gen case also has a tiny little dot on the front, a light that turns on when the case is charging wirelessly. The 1st gen case does not have that feature, so, of course, there’s no light on the front.But seriously, that’s the only feature you’re missing out on, other than maybe some better sound quality that you won’t really miss unless you’ve used 2nd gens before. Again, these are really great.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,I highly recommend because it’s so easy,"







  
  
    AirPods are great. These do not have noise cancellation and there are definitely headphones with better sound quality but the ease of use and battery is unmatched. These connect to just about everything and it is so easy to just carry around and pull them out when you need. I use them with my tv, phone, iPad.... I bought one for everyone in my family from Black Friday and we all have been loving them these past months.  They automatically connect to my phone but if I need I can easily switch to my iPad and laptop within seconds. It’s also great that two different AirPods can connect to one phone like if my gf and I want to listen to the same music. The battery life is a couple hours long and you can fully charge them in the case for less than 20 min. They last more than a day so all you have to do is remember to charge the case every couple days. My only personal problem with them is the case is so small. You definitely need a rubber cover or something because its  slippery.

I don't hear normal cabin noises while wearing them.However, they don’t stay in my ears as well as some people report.  I couldn’t use these while being active for instance. I’ve already chased one that fell out and rolled down a plane aisle.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,very light headset with rock solid sound quality!!,"







  
  
    Although I am huge Apple fan, I was initially skeptical about buying Apple AirPods. I already had a different brand bluetooth headset (which was so-so) and for some reason I didn't have high expectations of AirPods. But these AirPods really beat my expectations. They are light, easily chargeable and have solid sound quality. I mainly use it for business calls from iPhone, and this is just magic! Crystal clear quality, like snowflakes in my ears. I wish I got them earlier!! The only drawback is a bit weird way to check case charge level. You need to open the case in proximity to your iPhone with AirPods in. I find this strange, I wish there was easier and more streamlined way to check it. At any rate, this is a great product and I do recommend it to Apple fans!

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Really awesome product if you're investing in apple world,"







  
  
    Let me start with I just switched to the apple world within the last six months. Macbook and iphone after years of fighting it. That aside, these things are amazing and work seamlessly when going back and forth between macbook, iphone, car, etc. I have been using them for work not that I WFH as a teacher and then enjoy them in the afternoons as well. Definitely invest in a case right away, I've heard complaints of the case opening up too easily without one plus there are a bunch of fun cases you can get. When the charging case is charged these guys charge up in 20 minutes no problem from completely dead. If you don't have apple products I wouldn't spend the money, but the seamless ability to go between all of your apple stuff is 200% worth it if you are already invested and the sound quality is great.

    Airpods were one of the first earphones to come out that normalized talking to yourself in public. It use to be something that only those guys on wall street do but now, every body does it. Enter COVID, these are a lifesaver. I'm tired on signing on Zoom and not being able to hear people properly so I put on these wired headphones but the cords are all tangled up so I'm leaning over my laptop asking the group to give me a minute while I try to effortlessly untangle myself. In the end, I'm frustrated and given up on untangling so I'm hover a few inches above my laptop because that's the amount of wire I'm able to untangle.Look, there are cheaper ones out there that gets the job done for a fraction of the price if you're willing to ease up on the quality in both build and audio. If that's you, go for it. If you want decent audio, build that can last being stepped on a few times, and battery life that can last the work day then this is the one for you. I have no issues with Airpods thus far and can see myself using it for years to come.

I did buy them when they were more expensive so that sucks but I love how if one falls out your music stops playing, you can listen to music, take phone calls, listen to notifications and so forth. The charging case works great. I usually use them at work for a couple hours listening to podcasts and music. You don’t have to charge it all the time which I like as well. I highly recommend this product! Excellent price now and I would buy them again for others!

The sound it great.There is an occasional issue with the connection to my phone which means that I have to put them back in the case and take them back out to reset the connection and that seems to work very well.  I have even used them as the microphone to record video.  I love the set an use them so much I have to remember to charge them when not in use.  I believe it takes at least 3 - 5 hours on a call or listening to music or podcasts.Great product and I truly hope Apple does not stop making them incase I do need to replace them at some time.  I do not like the newer version as I said before.  I really do not like any headsets that plug into my ear canal.Great product and Highly recommended.

    Overall the airpods are ok, but they're very expensive when you could easily spend the money elsewhere and get somewhat similar quality bluetooth headphones. Not always does the battery life display on your phone or device sometimes i have to open and close the case a few times for the phone and or ipad to be able to see my device. It doesnt always connect either, thats another thing I dont like about these things. Also they can fall out easily from your ears and thats really ridiculous when you're already paying a premium price for the things. I have a pair of Bluetooth tenergy headphones that are water proof and bluetooth and do not fall out of my ears whatsoever because they have these black arms that wrap around the backs of your ears. They only costed me like $30 bucks and here im spending much more and they dont even stay in my ears at all.

    Music is my game, and I love to listen to my favorite music on a high noise level. No worries about bothering the neighbors, now. I purchased these from Amazon at a one time discount, a little nervous that I would not receive the quality. No worries, noise cancellation, perfect, quality of sound, excellent, ease of use , very easy.These arrived in a tight pa kati g as all of App'e products do. Once I got in and read the directions, it was very easy. The pods were at different levels of battery life,so I plugged them in. Both at 100% within a short period of time. The bBluetooth was turned on, instantly the ear pics were connected. I put them in my ears, and started listening to the new Rufus Wainwright’s CD, ‘Unfollw The Rules’. Beautiful music and Rufus’s voice came through. I am quite happy with these ear pods.Recommended. prisrob 07-31-2020

    I love this product and I use it every day.  For work I answer phone calls and I am very happy with the quality of both the sound I hear and the clarity of my voice to the people I talk to.  I often listen to audible books on tape while walking or running and it is very easy to use.  I prefer these to the more expensive product offered by Apple because it does not cancel all the external sound.  I think it is safer to be able to hear adequately the sounds around you.  Especially when exercising out side.  Your hearing can save your life from unexpected hazards like cars or bikes coming down the road.  The sound quality is excellent.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Left headphone does work! Just adjust audio,"







  
  
    This an an authentic beautiful pair of AirPods with excellent sound quality. I’m very active and run about 4x a week. These stay in my ears during my entire run. With that said I did have issues with the left headphone not working immediately upon opening and using. This seems to be a common issue among many users according to the reviews. I watched every YT tutorial and read several troubleshooting articles. I reset my AirPods and disconnected them from Bluetooth several times to no avail. I was just about to ship these back to Amazon, until I finally came across an article that helped solve the issue. The audio balance needs to be adjusted. Follow the steps in the photo I have attached and that should hopefully solve your issue. I’m leaving this review to hopefully help those who may have future issue with these headphones upon arrival. Hope this review helps.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Even as a PC person I enjoyed these.,"







  
  
    Let me start by saying I don’t like apple products typically and I think their marketing, product cycles and etc are not great.My feelings on the company aside, this product is genuinely very good. It has a long battery life, the charging case is well made and the earbuds click in and top closes with magnets so they don’t fall out or get lost easily. The case also serves as a portable battery pack for the headphones and it can be recharged with a standard iPhone charger. The headphones detects when you pull them out of your ears and pauses whatever you’re listening to and restarts when you put them back in and automatically connects to your phone. The noise cancelation isn’t so much I feature I look for but at medium to louder volumes you can’t hear things around you but at quiter volumes you can hear everything around you if that makes any difference. I normally don’t like iPhone headphones in general because they’re a bit big and don’t fit comfortably but these fit perfectly plus they’re small and inconspicuous.I bought a ton of other headphones but they all died, broke or were a pain to connect or charge.These headphones were overly expensive but they are better in every way and I fully recommend them.

    I was really hesitant on paying this much for ear buds but after considering I've spent more than this on cheap ones that aren't good I went through with it and I'm quite pleased. They are tapered so no need for those unbelievably uncomfortable rubber pieces other ear buds have. They are incredibly comfortable. I can wear them all day and never miss a beat, versus the thirty minutes tops those ones with rubber pieces that hurt my ears. They connect almost instantly, no need to try to pair them or anything like that. They sound fantastic and have a surprising amount of bass. I work construction and I can hear them over the noise at work. They last a good four hours and fully charge in 15 minutes.

    Babies are really really boring. if you find yourself in a situation where you have to be around one for long periods of time you need these. I was wearing the wired ones and the baby would just pull them out of my ears and suck on them. Now he has no idea I'm even wearing them. I can listen to full podcasts AND sing The wheels on the bus go round and round hundreds of times. The key is to cover them with your hair and only wear one at a time. I also love these for listening to sleep stories when you can't sleep at night. I used to wake up tangled in the wires.

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Apple is supreme,"







  
  
    It’s 2020, you should know by now that everything Apple is dependable and innovative. You have to own a pair to realize all the small and convenient features that Apple packs into their AirPods. Without going into the settings menu your AirPods are automatically synced just by holding them next to your iPhone. They stop playing music the second you remove them from your ears, you can customize minor commands with the double tap feature. In earphone usually drop out of my ears constantly but these stay in. The wired earphones that came with my IPhone 11s could not stay in my ears. I do have to admit that I wish these AirPods had a little more bass and were 10% louder, but with all the other features and conveniences added together these AirPods are still worth 5 stars.

Get your grandkids to beep bop and boop them to you multicellular device, but be careful because I here it gives you blueteeth when you connect without wires, oh it doesn’t contain wires except to charge and recharge and recharge and recharge ever time you need to use the air bud...I just loved that movie, the dog played basketballs and helped the team win, such a feel good movie. Oh I think you don’t need them fancy wires to charge your charge or recharge and recharge your air buds...the dog wore 23, and jumped and booped the balls with its nose. It uses a technology that was created in the mid 80’s to charge, its called Quiff, or Chi, or Tai-chi, but it’s spelled Qi (good luck trying to say it), however that there is a fancy case and it comes at a premium, I think the average cost of rent in low income places around town. Anywho. I see the guys and gals or guygals all over town wearing and harring these things, and just think they are lovely. You can have them in any color you want as long as its in white, this seems to be a identifier with Sir Issac Newton’s company. You would think with all those colors in the rainbow they would make snazzy fun colors that people could identify with. I done here they are making a Pro version, maybe Pro is sort for professional and tailored to professionals only, so usens can’t get them, unless you want to mortgage your living establishments. One last thing...you can voice control this air buds...I don’t recall if the dog dribbled the balls, because it has no opposable thumbs, and if it did I think the ref would’ve called travel or double drool-ble.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,A is for.... Another Awesome Apple product!,"







  
  
    I absolutely love these Apple AirPods. I have wanted some since the first generation and finally got a good deal on these on Black Friday. They are amazing and although I lost one for a couple hours, I would totally recommend them. I use one in my ear at all times and especially when I’m driving. The noise cancellation is awesome and I can hear everything even with just one airpod in. There especially good with driving because our state is hands-free now, so I don’t have to be afraid of getting a ticket or whatever for Driving and talking on my cell phone. Before I got these, I had two or three different cheap sets that I got for about 20 bucks each and every single time they broke. These have not broken it all and like I said even though I lost one for a little while, I was able to track it and find it with the find my iPhone app. They hooked up to my phone super easily literally I open my iPhone and then open the AirPods case and a little thing popped up on my phone automatically that showed it the battery life of these AirPods and connected them to my phone. It was very easy to do I never had to go to Bluetooth and do anything fancy I did it automatically on my iPhone. Totally worth the price in a really great buy and I’m very happy that I got them!

You can get little cases for them to protect the charging case which I recommend, and you can also get a little cord that you can attach to both of them so that they stay together in your ears and if your ears are too small you can get little adjustments that go over them to make them fit better too!
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Apple product. Spend the big bucks or don't do it at all.,"







  
  
    Good sound, they fit in the ears and do NOT fall out like corded buds. The sound is good, but don't expect audiophile level sound. You can't expect any better than this from tiny little ear buds. But the essential element to these are the freedom to walk away from your source with NO wires, nothing. The freedom is the charm here. That and the apple name make this worth the investment. Sometimes I use these, and other times for real music listening I use full size headphones. But for videos, non serious music listening and whatever else, these are great. I would say it's better to spend the extra money and get the good stuff, than spend twenty or thirty bucks on some unknown product. Expensive, but as all else in life you either buy the real deal or you buy some cheap substitutes. Ain't worth it....It paired effortlessly with my iPhone seven and my older iPad four.I recommend genuine apple products.

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Apple Care is a must!!,"







  
  
    I love my AirPods. Prior to purchase, I thought it was a total waste of hard earned money and I would not buy them! Until I kept losing/breaking my earbuds or headphones. Then I made the switch. I am happy to report that I have had my Airpods for almost one year and I am just as in love today as I was a year ago. They are lightweight, super convenient and functional, and I can't seem to live without them. I recommend looking into Apple Care for any and all Apple products that you are considering to buy. That way, in the event something happens to the item, Apple will replace it for you with little to no questions asked. I use these to work out, while I'm at work listening to whatever, or when I'm on the phone. The item arrived within two days and the packaging was discreet and left in a secure location on my property.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best!,"







  
  
    I held off purchasing these due to their cost.  I tried other knock off brands but now that I have the real ones, I understand what all the hype is about.  They fit perfectly in your ear.  They pair seamlessly with multiple devices.  They hold a charge.  These are the bomb and well worth the premium price.  The noise cancelling is OK but they really don't advertise that they are noise cancelling so I didn't purchase them with that in mind.  I am amazed that they rarely fall out of my ear so I really don't worry about losing them.  Just put them in the case when not in use - not in your pocket, not on your counter, not in your drink holder...you get the picture.  That will only lead to a lost earbud and frustration!  They are great and well worth the price!
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Too many knock-offs that don’t compare!,"







  
  
    We tried at least 4-5 different “knock-off” versions of the real deal air pods. They all had some of the features and functions but nothing beat the real deal. Should have saved the money and just gone with these in the first place. They are super easy to pair, to use and not fussy at all. We use them for working out, running, talking on the phone and just always have them. The battery life is excellent and overall, I wish I would have just spent the money on the real ones from the beginning — would have saved me a lot in the long run.

    I have gone through several brands of true wireless ear buds. There are some with super stereo sound and long battery life but such on phone calls because they pick up every noise within 100 feet.After experiencing that, I have found that Apple air buds are the best!! Battery life isn’t super long but there are so many other features that compensate for that. Ease of connection, automatic shut off when removed from your ears..etc. I could go on and on but really don’t have the time. I will end with this though. Apple air pods are a superior product and I still can’t believe how much I enjoy them. Don’t be fooled by imitations and knock offs.I regret having waited so long to purchase mine

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Still the Best,"







  
  
    I hate holding a phone to my head.  The radio waves are doubtlessly bad for us, and it takes away the ability to do anything else needing two hands while I talk on the phone.  Thus, I was wired until Bluetooth came out, and mostly disappointed until AirPods showed up.  I bought the original AirPods when they came out, and an inexpensive tether so I had ready access to them when a call came in.  After more than two years, I somehow lost one of the AirPods and while researching the cost of buying just one, decided to buy Gen 2 instead.  I'm not an audiophile, but the sound quality for calls, music, podcasts and books, is actually quite good.  As good as my noise canceling Sonys that cost twice as much...uh, no.  As good as they need to be to keep me happy?  Yes.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the price tag!,"







  
  
    I had my reservations about buying AirPods originally. They were just so small and expensive and I wondered if they even worked that well or if I’d lose them easily. Luckily those concerns were misguided as I can say they were definitely worth it (for me personally at least) I no longer have to worry about getting tangled in a cord when trying to do things while listening to music/talking on the phone/etc. and since they’re Bluetooth and have a pretty decent range I can leave my phone in one room of the house while I walk around listening to music from the pods. They also connect with my Apple Watch and allow me to stream music from there on runs where I’d rather not take my phone! I’ve gotten so much use out of them I think they were worth it for sure

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great product.,"







  
  
    I have owned several of these and I really like them. The only issue is the battery doesn't hold a proper charge after about 2 years and so they need to be replaced. Seems decent to me although I wish I did not have to replace them. Also, I much prefer these to the newer version of the AirPods with noise cancellation and the silicone ear holders. I found the noise cancellation did not help much and also they had a weird buzzing feeling that I found annoying. Also, the silicone ear holders are much more uncomfortable, at least for me.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Airpods generation 2,"







  
  
    These have been reviewed so many times I can’t really add anything new. If you like the wired Apple EarPods you will probably like these. They have a similar fit but more secure without the wires tugging on them. The sound is neutral and a little better than EarPods. The design allows you to hear what’s going on around you, which is important to me. Helps me not get run over while walking the dog. When I want a more immersive experience, listening to music in a comfy chair, I use large over ear headphones.Part of a review has to be based on value. I payed $115 and used a credit card that extends the warranty from 1 to 3 years. That made these a good value for me personally. Keep in mind that these can’t be repaired in any way. A “Battery Service” from Apple is just buying a new one.

The adapters for other earbuds did not allow a secure fit for me.

    Compre los airpods porque necesitaba unos audifonos inalambricos porque son muy funcionales. Sin embargo, me ha pasado:Cons:1. No lo logro conectar mis airpods con mi macbook air por medio de bluetooth. Se conectan y al segundo se desconectan. Me tocara mirar videos en youtube para poder arreglar el problema.2. El audifono derecho molesta mucho cuando hablo por telefono. Se oye como un ruido muy raro que molesta mucho. Ya me ha pasado varias veces en un periodo corto entonces los llevare al servicio tecnico en la tienda Apple.Pros:1. Son demasiado funcionales. Me los pongo y puedo hacer muchas actividades sin tener el cable regular de los audifonos pegado al celular y tener que llevar los dos de la mano.2. Se acomodan al oido muy bien. No he tenido ningun problema con que se me caigan mientras camino. No los he usado mientras corro.3. Son lo mejor cuando quiero hablar por telefono u oir musica y al mismo tiempo tengo que cargar mi celular. Antes cuando usaba los audifonos de cable tenia que usarlos o cargar mi celular. Ahora puedo hacer los dos al tiempo  sin ningun problema.

    I was hesitant to purchase airpods as they were a joke for a while that only rich people had them. But, after going through many cheap pairs of fully wireless earbuds I decided to bite the bullet and purchase airpods. Best decision I have ever made when it comes to my mobile audio. Airpods deliver great sound quality and fit surprisingly well in many different ear types. If you have an iPhone, these are the only earbuds you should even be considering getting with built-in optimization in iOS.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best I've Found For Phone Calls.,"







  
  
    I don't listen to music with my wireless headphones. I use them mostly for phone calls and Marco Polo. I have searched for 2 years for a wireless headset that filters out ambient noise so that the caller on the other end can hear my voice clearly. My search is now over. Nothing I've used works better than Apple Airpods. I don't know how Apple does it but they use some kind of technology that isolates the frequency of your voice and separates it from background noise. Its truly amazing. If you're tired of having the person on the other end of a phone call tell you they can't hear you very well because there's too much noise then these are the headphones for you.
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Why did I wait so long?,"







  
  
    I don't know why I put off getting AirPods for so long.  Its just too easy to pop out of the case and throw on an audiobook as I run some errands.  Battery life is pretty poor though.  I was on a discord chat and they lasted for just over 2 hours from a full charge.  Yet, it more than makes up for that in its convenience.  I would step up to the newer model (wireless case) if it had some real world battery gains, but the time for me considering that has gone and past.Just get a pair, any model will do.

    I wouldn’t call myself an Apple fanboy but their devices simply work, and do the one thing they are designated to do better than any other of its competitors. Now, I am not saying that there aren’t better earpieces but pair of AirPods simply music, style, and beat into one. One negative thing about is the fact of noise cancellation being almost none existent. Especially in the subway when the trains are passing by the only sound you hear is the sound of the train and nothing else despite having the AirPods on. Apart from noise cancellation AirPods blow away any other earpieces I’ve owned. With them having discount of 20 bucks I decided to get a pair and they are exactly what I hoped for. If Apple comes up with a newer model that takes care of the noise cancellation issue I will definitely upgrade.

    Amazing! Worth the money. I was on the fence of getting the new AirPod Pros or the AirPod 2nd Generation. I’m glad I went with the 2nd Gen AirPods. They are extremely comfortable. Sometime I forget they’re in (no bull...). It connects so seamlessly to my iPhone and feels like it belongs. I tried the Jabras... uncomfortable and no touchless “Hey Siri”. This even reads messages to you or can annouce who’s calling by tweaking some of your General Settings. I use them everyday. Start my morning with Youtube and Apple News updates, make calls, listen to music while working. They seem expensive but it’s worth the money. I also like that they don’t cancel out all of the noise and also work independently (I usually only have one in). However, when I really want full sound for music, I put both in and can barely hear the wind and road noise, on the highway, with the windows down. Good job Apple!

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Real AirPods. Great listening. Could use a longer battery life,"







  
  
    I mean they’re Apple so you know the sound quality is there. It’s very freeing to have Bluetooth headphones and they’re pretty comfortable.I had to give it a low rating on the battery life just because plenty of Bluetooth headphones come with an extremely long battery life (I’ve had Beats headphones that boast a 24-48 hr battery) and it’s a little disappointing given that Apple is a very well established company.I also checked the serial number of my pods and the validity of the warranty on Apple’s website. I can confirm that I received real AirPods. I would suggest anyone who is uncertain about buying from Amazon due to authenticity just make sure you’re not buying third party and check the serial number on Apples website so if you receive fakes you can get Amazon support on it right away. Serial number is located on the inside-top-left of the case.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect Product with a Critical Flaw,"







  
  
    Ah yes, the 2nd Generation Airpods from Apple that we've all been eyeing now. I'll keep it short - it plays sound quite nicely, with sufficient bass and crystal clear sound from all octaves and ranges. The sound quality and everything is practically perfect. It pairs effortlessly with any compatible Apple device (I have an iPhone) and it pairs almost before I put it in my ears. Never knew not going to the Bluetooth settings would be such a much-needed life-changing convenience.The only complaint is the noise cancellation. It does not have any whatsoever. Do not even think there will be 'a little', because there is absolutely none. If you're in a loud environment and you're struggling to hear your music, your only real solution is to either find a quieter place or turn up the volume and hope you don't go deaf. If there was noise cancellation (Airpods Pro has them now), then it would be a perfect product. It is a minor inconvenience that makes it feel not worth the price. To people who think it may not be a problem, then this is the product for you. Otherwise, go bump your purchase to the Pros.

    I'd been on the fence about AirPods for SO long. How could they possibly be worth it, right? They are. Earbuds with the little rubber attachments really hurt my ears after longer than a few minutes, and tend to make my ears itch. These are much more comfortable, and the best part is THEY STAY PUT. I tend to fall asleep listening to audiobooks and have never once had to go searching for an earbud when I wake up. Not only do they stay in my ear, but I'm in no discomfort for having slept on one for several hours. Love them!
  
"
7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Definitely worth every penny and then some,"







  
  
    I love my AirPods. I thought about getting the AirPods Pro but I didn’t wanna spend that much more just to have the noise canceling feature. Now I will probably upgrade in a year or two now that they’ve even improved the AirPods Pro even more.Coming from somebody who has an iPad and iPhone and an iMac at home having the AirPods and the ability to Switch between them so effortlessly without having to unpair and repair is so nice.I’ve had a number of Bluetooth headsets over the years from Plantronics to generic to a number of other different companies I don’t even know if I could remember every different manufacture that I’ve had. I always hated that they were bulky they never fit in my ear just right. I just never felt like they were great and it was always complicated they seem to fuss to pair up and especially if they ever unpaired then it was starting all over again. I love that the minute that I got my AirPods I flipped open the case and right away my iPhone registers that they are there and with the top of a Button on my phone and the top of the button on the AirPods in a couple of seconds I am paired up.I also have a very nice charger that I bought right here on Amazon for about $25 and it will charge my Apple Pencil my AirPods my Apple Watch and my iPhone all at the same time which is amazing and so nice that I can just click my AirPods case on there and they charge up in a very short time.First off I’m not a sound engineer or an audio file so I can’t say that they have the absolute best sound quality and I’m sure that they don’t I can’t imagine that if you went out and got some of the beads or some other type of wireless headset that fits over your entire ear with a bigger driver in it that of course it’s going to have better sound quality.But I love that they are tiny small and easy to just throw in the case. The battery life is great if my case is fully charged with the AirPods in and charged I can go to complete times to almost dead with both AirPods being used. If I only use one way talking on the phone I can go even more so in between case charging times is sometimes over a week which is absolutely amazing. The talk time on them is very long as well. I’ve never sat down and figured up exactly whether I get the exact time that Apple says.I love that the minute that I put them in my ear I get a nice little tone to let me know that they’ve connected if I’m listening to music and I take them out it automatically pauses. I love that it will even pause my music if I get an iMessage and it will read my message it will tell me who it’s from if they’re in my contact list if not it will read me the phone number and then read me the message and then asked me if I would like to respond all without touching my phone.I love Apple products even if they are a little more expensive in some areas but I love that for instance with the AirPods home they tie Effortlessly Into my phone my Mac and my iPad.I absolutely hate when I am talking on the phone for more than a couple of minutes to have to hold the phone. Also I run a business and so I have to multitask sometimes someone calls and I need to be able to pick up a remote to navigate to something to check I may need to grab the computer etc. and having the ability to have both hands free to do something like that while still talking and not worrying about the AirPods falling out of my ear is worth more than the money that I paid for them by far and then all the other features that come with it are great.So in the end I think that they are amazing and I’ve had it again a number of different Bluetooth headsets and they never fit right they fall out of my ear or the ones that took over my ears are always so uncomfortable after a short period of time that I never ended up using them I always ended up using my wired earbuds that come with my iPhone.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing as a hands-free.,"







  
  
    Bought these as a hands-free with intent to mostly use only one earpiece. Partly because my ears are clearly a bit different and while right bud sits tight, the other one falls out almost immediately while on the move. But the one that doesn't fills like it was made for that ear. Nice, snug and comfortable. It doesn't even make any attempts to fall out. Almost every aspect is perfect for what they were bought. Sound quality, distance (from iPhone), battery life, size, weight, ergonomics. My only complaint is price ofc. This can be said about all Apple products.Never intended to use them for music for obvious reasons, but I must say I expected them to sound way worse, than they do. For an average Joe they sound very decent. Still if you value sound quality, I would look elsewhere. These are clearly not for music enthusiasts.Bottom line. If you need earbuds for your iPhone mostly for the phone calls and occasionally to listen the music, look no further. Taken they will hold in your ears nice an snug, which I suggest you to find out before buying them.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best little headphones,"







  
  
    If I could befriend headphones, these would be the ones.  They're intuitive, easy to use, sound great, and worth the price now that I've had them a year and go nowhere without them.  I usually use one at a time so I can still hear around me and save on battery.  I've rarely dropped, but the couple of times I have, they've been just fine.  I love how easy they are to use with iPhone, MacBook, iMac.  They charge fast! I've not tried the pros, don't see any reason at this time because these fit comfortably and are so amazing!  I tried knock offs twice before these and am so glad I dropped that nonsense and bit the bullet on these higher priced, but oh so superior, headphones. I didn't think wires were a big deal until I moved to these and then tried to use the wired headphones once. Yuk. Almost pulled my MacBook right off the table. Goof. The case is slippery smooth; I would absolutely recommend a case of choice (I have Spongebob). Enjoy!

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Works like airpods.,"







  
  
    They're the most reliable wireless earbuds I've come across and you can get applecare with them, which has the best customer service I've come across. It was a little uncomfortable at first because I have smaller ears but my left ear got used to them and now it feels like I'm wearing nothing. They pair seamlessly and you really pay for quality and peace of mind. I've gotten plenty of knock-off earbuds for way cheaper but they always stop working after a few months. Now that I have these and the warranty, I know I don't have to go hunting again.

    Ones I got were authentic. Ordered during prime days and received same day. Gotta love amazons ability to satisfy instant gratification. Read some reviews stating the items received were replicas. I compared my current working pair I purchased directly through apple 06/2020 to the ones from amazon and they look and sound authentic. I wouldn't have purchased from amazon had I not had an authentic item to compare it to in hand already.

    So my mom used to take my old Apple headphones all the time cause the fit comfortably for here was always a pain lol so she has been looking for a good pair of ear buds for a long time. She’s not a tech person at all, so I thought these would be great for her sense she always took my old pair.So for Mother’s Day I got her a pair, oh boy I hit it right on the money. She absolutely enjoys them 100%, she tells me every time I see her how great they are. She wears one at work, uses them doing outside chores, going for walks, listening to books and so much more. The sound quality is better that your old ones and being wireless is so much more productive in life. Haven’t heard a complaint about them so far, so I recommend them to anyone looking for a good pair of earbuds.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Won’t be disappointed.,"







  
  
    Was planning on getting the pros for better sound & noise cancellation, but opted for the deal going for Airpods 2. Sound is loud and clear and battery life is never an issue, I’m pretty active most the day and when I do need to use airpods the battery life failing on me isn’t a problem. Using AirPods 2 for calls is smooth and listening is very audible. They’re just like the wired earpods when it comes to fit, but feel slightly better and since it’s wireless you don’t gotta worry about snagging onto things and falling out. I do weight lifting and jogging on the treatmill at the gym and with light cardio and they fit decent. Just plant em’ in your ear tight and you should be good. Flaws I could say is the fit may not be that great when doing heavy cardio workouts, so I’d recommend some ear tips for the basic airpods, Pros of course are naturally gonna fit better.TL:DR - Overall sound is good, battery life is good, and fit is decent. I got for $129 plus taxes & fees and highly recommend for someone looking to flex with airpods without shelling out too much and a good sounding pair of bluetooth audio devices.

    My son got these for me for Christmas. My phone picked them up instanly. I didn't have to do anything to ""hook them up"".  I registered them on the apple site and then googled how to use them. Well they are quite easy to use. I adjusted the settings for my right and left ear. I have had them in for hours and I forgot they were in. Now I understand why people walk around with them in their ears 24/7. I was also shocked to hear my incoming text read to me while I was wearing them. Wow!!! My husband is a tractor trailor driver, I will be getting him some for the sole reason of the text reading. I fully understand that I am 5 years behind the times but this review is for other middle aged people who have no idea what ipods are.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Sure, you can't afford these... but buy them anyway.","







  
  
    If you don't have AirPods yet, you may or may not know just how annoying earbud wires are.  If you don't have them yet, AirPods seem like a slight improvement from those much less expensive earbuds that came with your phone.  I came hear to tell you that AirPods are without a doubt the smartest purchase you'll make today.  Maybe, like me, you can't really justify spending $160 on earbuds, since you already have a pair and they're - fine.  Well... sometimes the key to success is learning to ignore your own ignorance.  There are things you shouldn't bother spending money on (cable tv, birthday cards, men's underwear that isn't Merino wool, meat at Wal-mart, etc.)  AirPods are not on that list. So stop questioning it.  Buy these magic ear spoons.  You'll bounce back financially in no time and forget you ever spent the money.  Sure, AirPodsare a little expensive, but consider the cost of not owning them.And no they won't fall out of your ears - unless you're driving on a back road in Maine in late February.

    I have to admit, I have been an Apple product hold out for years. I owned an i4S phone a long time ago and avoided Apple altogether. I owned upwards of a dozen other BT earbuds and thought i knew what quality was. I was wrong. I am impressed at both the voice clarity and battery life. There is no comparison. My daily commute can be 2 hours each way and I drive with them in enjoying my conversation. What I truly didn't expect but have a lot of respect for is when I drive with the window down, the person on the other end of the phone doesn't comment, doesn't complain about disturbance. Rock on. Finally I can retire the others and use this.

    I am a musician and as such have used a variety of headphones and earbuds. For recording you want a flat response but for pleasure, you want a slightly sweetened sound. I have two pair of Bose earbuds that I really like but I was shocked at how good these AirPods sounded. I heard instruments I’d not heard before. Better stereo separation and great deep but articulated bass.And they run for hours, handle voice commands perfectly and are great in my office for phone work. And they literally recharge to 100% in 15 minutesThese are the best sonic and overall earbuds I’ve ever owned.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love them!,"







  
  
    Absolutely love these!  Like others, I wish I hadn’t waited so long to buy them. They’ve improved my quality of life. I can now watch shows late at night without being worried about the neighbors complaining (I’m also a bit hard of hearing.) They have allowed me the flexibility to crank up the music while I’m cooking or cleaning. I can get lots more done and still enjoy the music. They help me understand the instructions in my yoga class as the sound is more consistent when I’m (or the instructor) are in different positions. They stay in place and recharge quickly. Even when I’m recharging my device, I can use the AirPod to listen to a program, ebook, music or whatever before falling sleeping and the next morning everything is good to go. Easy to set up with my other devices and that’s really saying something from me 😁.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Airbuds are great,"







  
  
    These Apple Airpods are great for listening while you are active doing other things. I was reluctant to order the AirPods because I had doubts that they would stay in my ears. So far, that has not been a problem. I am still somewhat paranoid that one will fall out of my ear and I will fail to notice. That concern is somewhat reduced because if one should fall out, they both stop working. I ought to be able to notice that. Sound quality is not great, but good enough to wear while you're at the gym or merely walking around. Some degree of noise cancellation is achieved by the pods blocking the ear canal. I would not want active cancellation because I want awareness of what is happening around me. I haven't taken note of the battery life because I recharge the case after each use of the pods.

    I have owned a decent pair of wireless earbuds to use with my iPhone for years.  They were great, had a great battery life, and could be used one at a time.  I could not, however, use them when making a call; the recipient could not hear my conversation.Bonus with AirPods that I didn't realize: there is a lot of built in Apple functionality that doesn't work with non-Apple ear buds. When you wear the ear buds, you receive audio announcements for texts and other app notifications.  I was not aware of that!

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Genuine 2nd Generation AirPods,"







  
  
    My AirPods were purchased directly from Apple and were shipped by Amazon, so I was expecting and received a genuine product.  I read a lot of comments regarding if these are the 2nd generation AirPods, and I was a little confused myself.  The charging case for the AirPods that I received had the indicator light on the inside of the case instead of on the outside; which is how Apple designed the first generation of AirPods.  After doing some research, this is also how Apple designed the second generation of AirPods, IF they do NOT have wireless charging.  So the only AirPods that do have the indicator on the outside of the case are the second generation, wireless charging AirPods.  After checking my products warranty on Apple's website, it confirmed that these are the 2nd generation AirPods; and also confirmed that these are real AirPods.

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great quality sound for music and phone,"







  
  
    I got these as a gift from my daughters and could not be happier. The sound quality is great! I use them for phone hands free driving, multi tasking while on the phone, work calls etc. as well as for music. They sound great and the feedback from other callers is excellent as far as how I sound. I can hear the caller and my music perfectly and they have great dynamic range for music.  The noise cancellation issue is a trade off that I rated fairly at a 3 but that is not a negative. These fit loosely so that makes them extremely comfortable to wear and just about forget they're on for long periods of time. However, the fact that they are loose fitting does allow other noise to enter. This is a positive if you are in the car, have other people that may speak to you from time to time while you're wearing them etc. To me these are a great balance. I have another brand that I've had for years that fit really tightly and while they block out ambient noise they're also less comfortable and it's really hard to have them on while other people are around or you're needing to hear anything at all except the headphones. To me this is a great balance and I am extremely pleased with these!

    I never thought wireless AirPods one day could be an object I can’t live without. We all know many other brands also have such great products. But I love AirPods just because it is so tiny, invisible, and I get so used to it. My ears love it. I love how free I feel with AirPods and unlike other wireless headphones, it is light and chic just as all those regular AirPods I have over many years. This is my second pair as I lost last one somewhere I still couldn’t recall. And it also made me realized that if I don’t open the case lid, my AirPods would never send out the signals. And I could no longer trace it as it clearly outside of the signal range of my phone.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Almost perfect,"







  
  
    My wife wanted these since the time I bought a pair for myself. These are amazing as they play audio as soon as you put them in your ears and pause when you take them out. A simple double-tap during music listening will skip forward. To adjust the volume, change the song, make a call, or even get directions, just say ""Hey Siri"" to activate your favorite personal assistant. Improvement over Gen 1. Plus, when you're on a call or talking to Siri, an additional accelerometer helps to filter out background noise and ensure that your voice is clear. They deliver five hours of listening time and they're made to keep up with you thanks to a charging case that holds multiple additional charges for more than 24 hours of listening time.We love it and can’t really think our daily lives without it.The only problem that I had sometimes that they slip from my ears. My wife though never had any such complains.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Excellent for calls on my Pixel 4,"







  
  
    I love Apple's hardware/build quality, but I don't like their software / find their ecosystem restrictive, so I try to avoid them.But they've totally nailed it with the Airpods.Stop overthinking this purchase.I've always liked the Apple wired earbuds, and these fit the exact same.A friend had the Pros so I could try them too, but I didn't like the feeling of them being deeper in my ear for long periods of time. And oddly enough, noise cancelling makes me feel physically ill (which happens to a small % of people with devices that do active noise cancelling).I chose these because my priority was microphone quality to sound clear on calls, whether at home or walking + talking. I like to walk + talk, but using my Apple wired earbuds made me feel very encumbered and it picked up all sorts of random background/street noise.Based on reviews, I can't seem to find Bluetooth earbuds that score as well on calls as Airpods.Airpods connect quickly + reliably and music sounds solid, too.And their charging case just feels convenient/awesome too.I think Airpods 2 are the perfect everyday versatile Bluetooth earbuds for anyone, from work calls to personal use (e.g. podcasts/music).I wouldn't recommend them for running/working out since I'd be worried about them always falling out of my ears. In which case, I think there are plenty of ~$40 Bluetooth earbuds that work well for that (and you're less distraught if you lose them / they break).If you don't mind earbuds deeper in your ears for longer periods of time, Airpods Pro could be great for all uses, including exercise.Unfortunately having an Android phone limits Airpods functionality, but I recommend the AirBattery app so you can easily see their battery levels.If you're in the market for Bluetooth earbuds, and you're not an obsessive audiophile - do yourself a favor and follow the masses by buying some damn Airpods (or Pros)! I wasted a *ton* of time researching and trying to find good alternatives outside of Apple...and they just really don't seem to exist.

    I’ve been in the market for new Bluetooth headphones for awhile while workingout. The ones I used were large, fell off easy, and would get in the way while lifting weights.I need something that wouldn’t destroy the bank, had a long battery life, and would stay in my ears while laying on a bench or pressing weights above my head.They connected to my phone with no issue after opening, the charger and booklet looked good as new.I highly suggest this to anybody looking for new headphones while at the gym, my only suggestion is to clean them after use if you sweat a lot to ensure they stay in good condition (though it isn’t necessary).You’ll need to charge fairly often though, after a new hour session, I find that the charging box will be about 50-60% battery.Hope this helps someone!

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,It's an Apple product what's to say?,"







  
  
    It's an Apple product, and like all Apple products its very beautifully and nicely packaged, and for the most part works very good.  And, like all Apple products they are manufactured by China for pennies on the dollar, and then Apple marks up the price by a thousand percent, and passes that very expensive price to US customers. Nothing more needs to be said about Apple products and business practices in the US, and support for foreign labor, instead of US labor. And, don't forget the Apple Care they would love for you to get, that strangely always seems to expire just a few days before your product gives out. It's like if they install a Mission Imposible ""this item will self destruct in 5 sec"" destruct switch inside your item to go off a few days before your Apple care expires.

    Bought these for my daughter for her birthday. She is in love with them. Of course who hasn’t been, but that’s standard, right? They work flawlessly, and seem to be doing everything the way they were supposed to. She has worn them everyday, and they have been holding up great. I would suggest that you keep the box that they come in as you would any Apple product, so that you have the serial number of them, just in case they are stolen. It has happened at her school, and the box is what saved the one child from having them gone forever. Luckily, I do not allow my daughter to take them to school, although I cannot watch her every move, so I trust she isn’t.

    These are very light. It's hard to imagine how some find these uncomfortable since they don't weigh anything. I wore one while working and with plenty of background noise and I could hear the airpod loud and clear. I also used with the Apple Watch w/cellular and that combo is excellent as well.  I haven't ran one dead yet but I don't listen to music all day long either.  The charging case really would fix and battery concerns though.  As far as music goes there's not really any bass.  It still sounds great.  I can't say whether any other ear buds are better though so may not be an issue.  They do seem to stay in the ear for all activities.  If you are wearing them under a helmet or hoodie (like I do) they can get pulled loose but I wouldn't worry about it falling out otherwise.

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Seamless connection and great fit,"







  
  
    Shocked that these fit as the free plug ins that apple provides never fit me. My ears are on the small side; I usually use the smallest plugs. These are not what I’d call secure but good enough. If I am going in walks (or working out) I suggest getting those clips that fit on the ends do that you don’t lose these as it does not take much movement to fall out. For seating or lying it is not a big issue. Seamless Bluetooth connection to the phone and can work easily with multiple devices. When switching just go to settings/bluetooth and hit connect if switching devices from the one last used. Could greatly improve the battery life, that being said they recharge quickly but this doesn’t help when in the go.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"AirPod 2 pods, Non-wireless Charger. Still an awesome product!","







  
  
    I’d like to mention some things to clear up confusion for some.The pods are AirPods 2 models with models A2032/2031 imprinted on the underside of each pod respectfully. Also when saying “Hey Siri,” the pods will wait for next response vs. the AirPods 1 where you’d have to set a double tap action to activate it.The charging case on the other hand is the regular lightning charging case without wireless charging as there is no light in the front to indicate wireless charging. This is indicated on the product details as it should and is correct. I personally do not thing the wireless charger is worth it unless you already have a wireless charging pad laying around so the regular will do.Overall, sound quality is great and clear.Battery lasts fairly long and are worth getting if you can get them for a cheaper price.I got these for my girlfriend and she loves them. You will definitely see me in the AirPods Pro once my original AirPods die and they became cheaper.I suggest getting some in-ear rubber hooks if they seem fairly slippery as they can improve the quality with some added bass. Not drastic but good enough, noticeable difference, and they won’t slip and fall out when you’re working out. :)

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,A major improvement over most earbuds and intelligently links with my iPhone,"







  
  
    I bought this because of a holiday sale. More than I would usually spend on earbuds, but I had recently upgraded my iPhone and my new model only has the lightning adapter for headphone connections. While I did but adapters for it, the brand I bought didn't seem to work (there were three in the package and I haven't tested the others yet). When I saw this on sale, I went ahead and purchased it. It is a joy to use and sounds great. Once linked yo your phone, the Airpods link to the phone the minute you open the charging case and pull out the buds-- automatically. And while I prefer a rubberized tip, the molded plastic does not fall out of my ear. So I'm very happy with the purchase.

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,I see now what all the fuss is about,"







  
  
    I didn't originally want to spend the extra money for airpods, and had some other brand wireless bluetooth headphones. Those worked fine (until they stopped charging for no reason), but the airpods really do work so much better, especially if you have an iphone. Connecting them to the iphone takes seconds, you just hold the case next to your phone and open it. The sound quality is great. The automatic pausing when you take out one airpod is a great feature, and they have a pretty long range - I can leave my phone downstairs and still be connected. The battery life isn't the longest but they charge super quick so it's not a big deal. They're also really comfortable, I have weirdly small ears and I can wear these for hours without any pain or irritation.

    I really-really like them!!! I was dropping my iPhone pretty regularly (and, therefore, had to send it to Apple for an out-of-warranty battery replacement couple of times) because headphone wires kept getting somewhere (cabinet knobs and handles most of the times). So my wife decided to get me wireless ones. And these ones rock!* Sound quality has definitely improved. I'm sure Apple has a smart explanation for that  but all I can say is yes, I hear that the sound is better in these headphones than in regular (wired) ones.* Noise cancellation definitely works - I have to remove one of the headphones to hear someone.* Cool feature: when you remove one of the headphones from your ear, the video/music you're currently watching/listening to is paused!!!! Can you believe this??? But wait! There is more! When you put that headphone back in, that video/music is resumed!!!  magic!* Battery life is good/excellent (I'd rate it 4.5 out of 5). It is definitely not outstanding/fantastic/mind-blowing but it is pretty darn good for the size.I can't thank my wife enough for this present!

2,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Love them, wish the battery life on actual airpods were longer","







  
  
    I love them, never been fond of Bluetooth ear pieces because they were too big but these are perfect. The battery life is pretty decent. I try to only use one ear at a time because they can block out sound, your ears will hurt if you wear them too long, and of one battery goes low I can switch to the other ear. The AirPod charging case battery lasts pretty long it’s the airpods that lose charge quick depending on how much you use them. If you’re a heavy user I suggest putting them in charging case everyday and putting charger case on its lightning cord. if not you can get away with charging them in the case without the lightening cord and only need to put the case on its lightening cord every so often.

    I had been putting off buying a pair of Apple Airpods for a few years now just because I refused to pay so much money for wireless headphones and I bough other brands of ones instead that were much cheaper. They all sounded terrible and worked just okay, but I finally pulled the trigger on these and I wish I had done it years ago.  They're great.  They sound pretty good and they just work.  I love that I can make phone calls with them and have Siri at my beck and call whenever I need something.  Also I love that I can use just one at a time, and it can be either the right or left one.  These are well thought out, as most apple stuff tends to be.  Only thing I don't love is the battery life, but I guess what do you expect for things so small?!

    In ear headphones are tough for me - they are either uncomfortable or fall out. These are not either! I can wear them for hours and they stay comfortable. As a runner the fear of them falling out was strong at first. However, after YEARS of using my first pair, I never once had that problem. On the road or the treadmill, for hours of running. After about 5 years my first pair finally gave up on life and I bought these and they are much the same and I feel they are worth the investment.

I opened the box and everything was there. It came with the chargeable case with a pair of AirPods. Also a Lightning to USB cable for charging, as well as all of the printed materials.They paired very easily with my iPhone XR. They are super easy to use and the sound is superb. I highly recommend these if you want a great pair of ear buds. Obviously, they aren’t gonna work well while cutting the grass due to the noise. However, if you want a quality set of ear buds, these are the ones.I want to add, these are the latest (2nd Generation) Apple AirPods. I did check on the AirPods themselves and the model is A2032. I just wanted to add that last little bit in case someone questions whether these indeed are the latest model available.

    Definitely genuine Apple product, and they came in sealed Apple packaging. But I was dismayed that they came already named.I was further upset that they were named:”stupid’s AirPods”.Ok, yeah, perhaps  I am in fact stupid... but still, how did they know that?🤣Anyhow, they work well.Although, this will likely be the last time I buy an Apple product from amazon.

8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Convenient, Good Sound Quality","







  
  
    Most convenient purchase of my life. Easy to walk around the city and have my podcast in my ears on my way to work. Some of which are poor quality so it's nice to have high quality buds so I don't miss a single second of the true crime stories. They stay in my ear so well! And sometimes I forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable and light. And the charging case is genius, you put you buds securely away and they charge without you having to think about it. I charge the case every couple days and can listen to fully charged bugs for a solid 1/4 of a day before I need to charge again. And with my hair down, my coworkers have no idea I am tuning them out with cold cases and serial killers.

    Well, I think I love these for the reason everyone else does. No annoying wires, discreet if you have long hair 😊 sound is great and works seamlessly with your iPhone. I find myself listening to music far more than I did before and telephone conversations, on the go, are a breeze as well. I did have problem getting them delivered but I won’t go into it because Amazon made it right fairly quick. And just to let you know because I read all the questions and answers before purchasing, no Amazon is not lying to you these are the latest model AirPods ( gen 2 ) but without the wireless charging case. The case still holds extra charge but you will have to plug it in to charge. You can tell you have received the 2nd gen by turning on messages with Siri, only with 2 gen and some Beats headphones Siri can read you your text messages as they come in. Cheers!

0,5.0 out of 5 stars,These Classic Earbuds Are Great,"







  
  
    I tried a some earbuds that were highly rated by CNET and they sounded so tinny that I had to return them.  Bought the Apple AirPods and all was well. I use the earbuds mostly to get the news from NPR, so I was interested in talk clarity. The Apple AirPods fit the bill. I have tried ear phones that had built in noise canceling and found that the noise cancellation affected the quality of the audio, so the fact the AirPods did not have noise cancellation was a plus for me.  Something to consider, after a lot of hard use and occasional drops to the cement, my last set of Apple AirPods gave out after 3-4 years.  Hopefully, the new ones will last longer.
  
"
1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Amazing,"







  
  
    These earbuds are great. I was hesitant to get them at first, fearing they would fall out of my ears or I would lose them. They are secure in my ears whenever I wear them and carrying them around in the charging case makes it less likely to lose them. I did forget about them in my pocket and ran them through the wash. I took them out and they played normally right away. I put them in rice for 72 hours and they still played fine.I have used these with my iPhone XS, Windows 10 laptop and iPad and for all devices they work great.I am still getting used to the commands/taps that come with these. I would like to find more info on that.I bought these when they were under $100, which I felt was a steal. They are great to have!
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best Purchase,"







  
  
    After trying so many other bluetooth earbuds, these are the best ones yet. I am an Android user and was told by iPhone users that the Airpods won't work, well the did. Great sound quality for myself and the other person on the other end of the phone/video call and for music as well as a long lasting battery. I'm going to feel like Oprah during Christmas is this $99 sale is still going on, EVERYONE in my family will receive an AirPod 2 Gen. I love them and my husband does too.

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,Grandson is happy with the AirPods,"







  
  
    These were purchased for my grandson.  He likes them very much and I purchased the case for him to store them in for protection and safety.  He can clip them to his pant loop and go and know they are protected and safe.My only concern is the music he chooses.  I pray he is listening to music that will edify and not influence him for wrong.  Music is powerful and has a great influence over all of us.  So much out there today I wouldn't want anyone to expose themselves to, but being a grand mother, it is not my responsibility to govern his ears and heart, but I pray for him.  Yes, I bought the AirPods.  He is going to listen regardless of how he listens.  Just hoping his heart is right and he will listen to music that edifies his spirit.  We should always remember Shadrack, Mechach and Abednigo.  When they heard the music they were to bow to the image.  Just sayin.  The AirPods are nice.  I would recommend them.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Tried the imitations - these are worth the money!,"







  
  
    We initially tried a pair of AirPod-like earbuds and they were pretty good. It was just difficult paying $200+ for earbuds when there were so many good alternatives on the market. When the price dropped, we decided to give the real deal a try and boy are we happy with our decision. All of the Apple convenience (easy pairing to all devices, sound, great fit, small footprint) shine through and make these a wonderful set of earbuds.

5,5.0 out of 5 stars,No going back!,"







  
  
    Someone told me that buying airpods was like buying an ipod.....once you had that ipod, there was no going back to a CD player!  It's the same thing.....once you have the airpods, there's no going back to headphones with a cord!If you are delaying, just BUY THEM.  Of all the new tech items I have bought (apple watch, google home, etc.), this is the one that I can say with absolute certainty that is essential.It's a godsend when I'm walking my dog, talking to people while doing other things like folding laundry, or just being able to listen to my podcasts/music while doing chores.Do it!
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Just do it!,"







  
  
    I have an iPhone XR and wanted some wireless headphones. I went with an off brand at first and it was a terrible decision. After that experience I knew I needed to just buy the Apple brand and get a good product. Yes, they are a little more expensive than an off brand - but seriously? They are worth it and more.If you're hesitating like I did at first... Let me tell you for sound quality, battery life, and ease of use - this is the product you want. No doubt.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,My perfect Bluetooth headset,"







  
  
    These headphones are perfect for daily use. The charge time is fantastic as well as the over all life of the headsets. The sound quality is as expected, they have good low end for that they are, the mid’s are clear and high end is bright. As these are not a completely enclosed ear bud they do have a little ambient back ground bleeding. This small amount of extra noise isn’t a problem. I use these ear buds when I ride my motorcycle under my helmet. I have no problems with to much wind noice or other sounds blocking out what I’m trying to listen to. I find it’s nice to have some noice reduction with out being completely blocked off from my surroundings. I’ve had no issues with them falling out of my ears or being bumped out of place.
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,Worth the money,"







  
  
    My friend who I talk to on the phone every day tried a bunch of cheaper brands and we would always have trouble hearing each other or they would break. Then she got these and we both noticed a big difference. So I got some for myself and am very happy with them. They are worth the extra money. Sound quality is great. It is easy to have a conversation in the car or while walking or doing other things. Get the rubber cushion thingies too, or the newer version that has them built in, or you might have trouble with them falling out. I never leave them in more than an hour and the battery lasts at least that long.
  
"
9,5.0 out of 5 stars,AMAZING!!!!,"







  
  
    These things are amazing. I bought these when my old ones where lost and I couldn’t go with my beats; I bought them because they where the cheapest AirPods. But these things sound amazing, they noise cancel fine for when I’m on the bus in the morning and I need to drown out all of the noise, they are also very, very, very comfortable sometimes I forget they are not in my ear. Also they can go a full week on one charge and I have them in for at least 5-7 hours every day. But all around the only small complaint is the noise canceling is you have to have the AirPods at almost full blast. But all around great headphones
  
"
0,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great headphones for the apple user,"







  
  
    I bought these for my GF for Christmas and she is in love.  Before this, she hadn't had any wireless bluetooth earbuds before, so this review is coming from a ""non audiophile"" and first time user for headphones like this.  it paired to her iPhone instantly and she says the fit is very comfortable.  She often wears them for hours listening to audio books.  There ins't much in the noise cancelation catagorey, but that's expected with ""buds"".  The fact that you can pause the music with gestures and also by taking one ear bud out blew us away.  Would recommend this product or any Apple user looking for a great pair of buds.

    I just received these thinking they were the Apple AirPods 2 (as description says latest model). I received the first generation pods which I already had. Very disappointed - there was almost a month long wait. I was so excited to get to mailbox after work today...womp womp
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,Love AirPods,"







  
  
    This is my second pair of airpods. I absolutely love these things. I think these ones are better than the pros if you want to be able to wear them but still have a concept of what is going on around you. I use these all the time for phone calls, and people say that I am heard perfectly. It makes hand free talking extremely easy. I wear them for school work, and for music as well. I am extremelypleased with the sound quality on these little guys as well. If you are looking for someone completely noise cancelling, get the pros. But I think these hold a lot of value in not being as noise cancelling because you can wear them in public and still know what is going on around you for safety.

    So I bought these for my husband because he kept telling me how much he loved mine and. Let’s face it lol I didn’t wanna come home one day and they be gone … so I bought these and he absolutely loves them and uses them all the time .. definitely worth the money and very well used .

4,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Great sound, perfect for remote working","







  
  
    With COVID forcing my employer to send us all home to work remotely.  I was using my gym headphones for conference calls.  I finally decided to give in and purchase some Airpods after I came to terms with the ""new normal"".  (I can't fully express my distaste for that phrase ""new normal"").  Anyway, I digress, I was skeptical if they would stay in my ears comfortably as I have ALWAYS had issues with headphones staying in while working out.  They work perfectly for both conference calls and gym time.  My calls are clear for both myself and those listening, and when I work out (and run) they stay in without me having to mess with them.  Also, with my pumpkin spice lattes, Ugg boots, and now Airpods I can truly take my ""basic"" look to a whole new level!
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,the only style that fit my tiny ears,"







  
  
    These stay in.  They sound good.  FINALLY I found a pair that work!  I tried several brands of ear pods for under $50 as I didn't want to spend so much on something that I felt is easily lost. Every other pair fell out and frankly I don't want 100% noise cancellation when I'm out in public because I just don't feel it's safe not to be aware of your surroundings.  I am SO glad I took the plunge and splurged on these.  They pair easily.  They are comfortable (4/5 rating).  They are easy to store safely on my Apple watch attachment. Sound quality suits me just find.  I'm using them for my skype meetings at work with no problems. And they do not fall out!
  
"
6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Life changing,"







  
  
    Well, I was late on the purchase of these because I didn't want yet another piece of electronics to keep up with and charge! Yet, now I am here to tell you that these are an amazing, and well pretty much life changing. No more having to untangle the headset cords, or only being able to charge your iPhone while listening to a podcast or music; or slamming them in the car door (yes, I managed to do this while on the Vineyard for vacation) and all but destroying them. The charge lasts pretty much a full day.

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Best thing since sliced 🍞,"







  
  
    I ordered these on Prime day because I just couldn’t resist. My package arrived a day before the estimated date so I couldn’t be more excited. Great so far except I can’t seem to get the double tap function down. I’m not sure if it’s not working properly or if it may just be user error.  Also, it states in the product description that this IS the WIRED version. It seems that there may be confusion about this feature. This has been my first day using them and I will make sure to update this review if anything changes. These AirPods appear to be authentic after verifying the serial # on the official checkcoverage.apple.com site. It states they are indeed the 2nd generation., I’m not sure if people are getting used/ refurbished AirPods after sending them back as a return, but mine seemed to be in the original packaging and untouched.
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,"Skeptical at first, they're the best!","







  
  
    Truthfully, I waited a very long time to buy AirPods. I was concerned with their battery life, their ability to fall out of my ears, and especially their price. When I purchased the headphone jack-less iPhone 8 though, I knew it was time to switch.I love them! Their battery life is very impressive and you can charge just the case which is super cool. I didn't think the increased range of mobility would be that big of a deal, but it is so convenient to be able to have a greater range of motion while running. I can even cook and clean very easily all with music and not worrying about being attached to a phone. After trying them, they do feel pretty secure in my ears. Also, the sound quality is immaculate compared to my previous 20 dollar corded headphones. I'm going to college next year so I'm super excited ill be able to have complete focus even if others are making noise. My music is so clear!For all my skeptics out there, if you can afford them of course, they are a great purchase! I recommend.

9,5.0 out of 5 stars,Junk!,"







  
  
    Pretty sure these are a fake knockoff or just super defective. Bought them for my daughter for Christmas, she just heard me tell my husband I was going to order myself a pair & she told me I could have hers since she never sides them since they “too hard to use”. I asked her what she meant & she told me that they are difficult to pair to her phone & IF she can get them paired they always disconnect shortly after. And she’ll charge them for a few hours & when she goes to use them the battery is dead. Pretty bummed that we wasted almost $200 & it’s past the return window now.

    There is only life before airpods and after and I don't ever want to go back to life without them.I recommend these to anyone who is a heavy apple user with multiple devices as these are made to sync with your iCloud account easily across multiple devices. Add exceptional apple sound quality, sleek, sexy look and the features you get from the smart chip there is no competition.I got the silicone tips for mine and It has transformed these already amazing headphones to near perfect! It makes the bass louder and cancels out the background sounds.RIP to all my other headphones.

    Life in this coastal area became incredibly noisy this year of CV19, lots of new residents, lots of noise and discourteous behavior.  Hard to take the daily onslaught of noise from these fools, until purchasing these AirPods.  Ideally, people would be respectful of one another, but we know that to be a largely bygone trait.  Now, instead of taking a drive or retreating indoors to get away from the racket, I just use the AirPods to both cancel and drown out the nonsense.  Wish I'd thought of it sooner.

    i am new to aipods but i think they are great! the sound is so good, sometimes when its a recorded voice, i think someone in the room is talking to me. i have a bit of a problem keeping the left one in so i bought a lanyard so that i don't lose it. whomever I'm talking to has no problem hearing me as opposed to my iPhone 12 without the airpods. i don't know what the standard range is but was also surprised how far i can be away from my phone so that i can get other things done while I'm on the phone.highly recommend

3,5.0 out of 5 stars,I love these!,"







  
  
    I was disappointed when Apple ""forgot"" the earbud jacks on new iPhones, forcing me to buy a more expensive alternative.  But actually, those corded earbuds hurt if they accidentally got yanked out of your ears.I'm impressed with the sound - much better than my old corded earbuds.I'm impressed with the battery life, but how do you charge them in use? - if you anticipate running low when you're on hold for hours with your cable service, you can put one in its charging case and use the other by itself, then later swap them.The charging case has a magnet to suck them down solidly on the electrical contacts and prevent them from spilling out accidentally, but it makes them awkward to retrieve from the case with big fingers.They practically Bluetooth-synced with my iPhone all by themselves.  And when you open the case near the iPhone, the iPhone tells your the battery level of both the earbuds and the case.I just wish they came in other colors, like black to match my iPhone.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,They're AirPods,"







  
  
    They were brand new and a lot cheaper than Apple was selling them for (I bought them on sale). I use them most days. These are my second pair of AirPods. They only last about 18 months or so before they don't hold a charge long enough to be useable. The updates with Big Sur and iOS 14 made them even better since they automatically switch devices depending on where sound is playing. Sadly, this isn't perfect and the AirPods will favor my iPhone over my MacBook Air and they will automatically connect to my phone first when I have something playing on my computer.
  
"
5,5.0 out of 5 stars,Perfect until they weren't!,"







  
  
    Can't say I have ever bought a more perfect item.  The case is small and white so easy to find in my crowded purse or on my crowded desk.  The phones pair easily, are quick to put on and the sound is awesome. No cables dangling around makes them perfect.  I watch movies on airplanes, using my ipad or cell phone without bothering my seat mates.Not quite 3 months later they stopped worklng.  i went to the great Apple Support site and learned how to reset them. That lasted  an hour and now they are dead again.  I'll be back here IF I can get them permanently fixed.  i miss them soooo much!

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Buy these off prime and NOT third party!,"







  
  
    Love my new iPods!! The sound is good, there’s no noise canceling to them but still does it’s job well. I had before bought the JBL wireless pods due to the great price, which I still have, the only issue I had with those was that the pods would fall out easily out of my ears and almost had a clogging sensation when I put them in, rather when I put my ipods in, they fit perfectly and won’t move much at all and stayed in place. (I have small ears) Also, I read a lot of these reviews on these saying these iPods are fake or dirty or whatever and I got legit iPods in the box, plastic cover and all, so they are real! Those people saying they are fake or defective probably got them from a 3rd party seller so my suggestion is to buy them off amazon prime itself and not third parties. Overall I’m super happy about my purchase!!

    Wireless AirPods are the best and I feel more confident these will remain in my ear.  I compared them to the newer version short stick and I like these better.  Great therapy at the dentist to cancel out drill noise.  I have regular Bluetooth wire EarPods I’ll continue to use as a backup for exercise. I feel these will stay in place for walking.  It is a little difficult to advance songs by tapping but with practice I hope I’ll adjust to them

    I bought these for my daughter who has a difficult time finding ear buds that fit comfortably in her ears. We have tried many different types and none fit well enough to be comfortable or stay in her ears. A friend let her try one of their AirPods and she loved the feel and that it stayed in place. Definitely more expensive than I’d like to spend for earbuds but worth it after going through so many other kinds. She is very impressed with the sound quality compared to cheaper versions as well.

    I can’t believe I’ve waited so long to buy these AirPods for myself. I borrowed my sons to go to the gym and I was hooked. I checked on line and Amazon had the best price, shipped in one day! Came sealed in original Apple packaging, they work beautifully, sound super crisp! Same 2nd Generation as my sons. No charging light in front, no problem, light on inside case. Comes with charging cord. I bought the silicon case in picture and keep them on my keychain.

1,5.0 out of 5 stars,Overpriced but works well and you’re in the club,"







  
  
    This is a good product if a little overhyped. Comfort is good but not great. The sound is good but not great. The noise cancellation is very good. Used for the phone I usually only put one ear in and I’m told it sounds great and I can hear good.The only things - my trucker headset I can say answer phone and it does. This doesn’t, so I have to actually answer my phone and it will often switch out of airbud mode and go to phone for phone calls. I’m looking for hands free and this kinda fails on that one. And lastly, way overpriced.
  
"
2,5.0 out of 5 stars,As good as they say,"







  
  
    I'm very impressed with the AirPods.  My wife has been wanting me to get a pair for years, but I resisted (I'm on Android, so I knew I'd lose a bit of functionality - my wife has an iPhone).  But, I finally gave in when they had a good sale, and I love them.  I wish there was a gesture that would ""jump back"" my playback, but at least double tap does a pause/play.  Super comfortable, very long battery life, excellent sound quality.  Even the charging case is excellent: not too small (to get lost), nice magnetic lid (doesn't open unless you want it to), good feel.  The Apple designers know their ergonomics!
  
"
3,5.0 out of 5 stars,They are real 2nd generation.,"







  
  
    They are real 2nd generation. I'm not sure why some people mentioned they got 1st gen. For a moment I also thought they sent me the 1st gen, because I already have one pair of 2nd gen and the ones I already own have a green light outside on the case, and the airpods I got from this seller has the green light inside (you have to open the case to see it). I realized that is because I had wireless charging case (light outside), while here I got the regular charging case (charging light inside). I was not aware of that difference. Best advice: before you comment you got 1st gen please check your serial number on Apple website to validate. It will show you what model you got. Besides that: they are the best pods, I wear them all the time, I even fall asleep with them and they're super comfortable. I am used to wearing only one, then whenever it dies, I just take another one, while the first one will charge.
  
"
4,5.0 out of 5 stars,Airpods are terrific. Should have gotten them long ago.,"







  
  
    I bought the Apple Air pods not expecting much. But, I was impressed right away with the sound quality and ease of use. They pair very easily with my Apple iPad, iPhone and iMac. I find the sound tilted up a bit in the midrange. That works perfectly with my hearing roll-off. I can hear phone calls, videos, etc. way better now. They are great for my streaming my Bandcamp purchases and they even pair fairly well with my Hiby R3 Pro and Hidiz players. I am really glad I bought them. My only complaint is they are very slippery and I fuss trying to get them out of the charger (also slippery).

    This is my second pair of airpods. The first pair I bought new on eBay and thought I was getting genuine Apple ones but they turned out to be fake and are of awful quality. I've been supremely pleased with the ones I got from Amazon. They connect to my phone the instant I pop them into my ear and stop playing the second I take one out which is a super feature when a family member talks to me. No fumbling with the volume button on my phone! The fit into my ear isn't great and I'm going to look into something that will help that out, but overall, I'm very satisfied and definitely recommend this product!

6,5.0 out of 5 stars,Great Upgrade,"







  
  
    Headphones are great and make chores and gym easier as I don’t get the wire snagged like my other headphones in random things. Battery life is awesome and I’m between uses the charger case makes quick work of charging. I was concerned about running out of batteries because I will have heavy use occasionally, but the case charges the pods quick and the case charges fully in like 10 minutes with them inside. GREAT buy, especially with Prime Day prices. Only issue is they don’t seem to cancel as much noise? Maybe because of some of the tech lime automatically pausing when one comes out kinda thing? Who knows? Also when you get sweaty you have to pay more attention because they slide a little easier but overall an amazing upgrade to my wired ones!

7,5.0 out of 5 stars,Wore it for 24 hours and experienced some progress. Still the best one,"







  
  
    The airpods 2 inherit the first generation design, and the appearance is almost the same as the old model. Same color, same material. But this time, apple put difference in the details.1. Long battery life. It can last for 24 hours with fully charged. And the new charging box improves the charging efficiency of the headset. 15 mins box' charging can get up to 3 hours of listening and 2 hours of talking. It is 1 hour longer than the first generation airpods.2. Faster connection speed. After adding the H1 chip,there is a big increase in connection speed when pairing devices. When pairing and devices switching, airpods 2 will respond twice as fast as the old model. It is easy to feel that.The airpods 2 remain the best wireless earbuds on the market.
  
"
8,5.0 out of 5 stars,The best in ear wireless headphones,"







  
  
    Hands down the best wireless in ear headphones.  Pairing with an Apple device is seamless, they auto pause/play when taking them out of your ear, they simply work all the time.  Sound quality is very good.  Battery life is excellent and lasts almost all day listening, shorter life if using for talking.  But a quick 10-15 minute charge brings them back for use again.  The only down side is they don’t block outside noise at all and are not great for air travel because of outside noise.  I also have AirPod pros which are perfect for blocking out the background noise.

    These wireless earbuds are amazing. They have a smooth connection to your phone and the possibilities of what they can assist you in, in your everyday life to make things easier are endless. They make listening to music, podcasts, phone calls, and talking to Siri almost effortless. The 2nd generation Apple AirPods automatically connect to your phone through Bluetooth first thing when you open the wireless charging case. The wireless charging case charges your Airpods just by inserting them into their spots and closing the case. By charging your AirPods in the case for just fifteen minutes you have up to 3 hours of battery life in each AirPod. Another feature that comes with the AirPods is being able to customize certain things of the wireless earbuds to how you would like them. There are two ways you can customize them. The first one is by choosing what you'd like engraved on the case. The options of what you can engrave on them is limitless. Some common things people engrave on them are their name, phone number in case they were to lose them, or a favorite quote. The other way you can customize them is by the name you want them under. When your AirPods connect to your phone, it shows the name they are under on your phone screen and you can choose what you’d like that name to be. I love my 2nd Generation Apple AirPods and I can’t say enough good things about them. If you are looking for a reliable wireless earbud, these are definitely for you.
